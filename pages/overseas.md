Loan words and overseas Teochew language
========================================
{: .no_toc}

A substantial fraction of Teochew people live outside of mainland China. As a
result their languages have diverged, and overseas Teochew has developed its
own distinctive dialect terms. Here is a sample of some interesting examples,
mostly from Singapore and Malaysia. Many of the examples are from Li (1991).

Local words
-----------

These words are not commonly used in mainland Teochew, or used in a different
sense among overseas Teochew communities.

### *bhah4* • 肉 • “meat”

The word used for “meat” on the mainland, *nêg8*, is cognate to Hokkien *jiok*
and Mandarin *ròu*. However, the origin of *bhah4*, which is also used in
Hokkien, is unclear.

### *gong1si1* • 公司 • “shared”

Standard usage is like Mandarin, meaning “company” or “clan organization”,
however in Singapore Teochew it is also used as an verb or adverb meaning
“shared”.

> tsi³⁵ko⁵³ mueʔ²kĩã³⁵ kʰoiʔ² niŋ⁵³ nõ¹¹ naŋ⁵⁵ **koŋ³³si³³**
>
> Zi2(6)go3(2) muêh8(4)gian2(6) koih8(4) ning2 non6(7)-nang5 **gong1si1**.
>
> 只塊 物囝 乞 恁 兩儂 **公司**。
>
> This-piece thing give you (pl.) two-people **share**.
>
> This is for you two to share.
>
> (example from Li, 1991)

### *pang5(7)gêng1* • 旁宮 • “room”

The mainland pronunciation is *bang5(7)goin1* 房間.

> niŋ⁵³ boi³⁵ keŋ³³ tsʰu²¹³ kui³⁵kai¹¹ pʰaŋ¹¹keŋ³³
>
> Ning2 bhoi2(6) gêng1 cu3 gui2(6)-gai5(7) **pang5(7)gêng1**?
>
> 恁 買 間 厝 幾個 **旁宮**？
>
> You (pl.) buy CL house how-many **rooms**?
>
> How many rooms are there in the house that you’ve bought?
>
> (example from Lim, 1991)

### *deng5(7)nang5* • 唐儂 • “ethnic Chinese”

Obsolete term in mainland Chinese, but the expression survives in Mandarin
*Tángrénjiē* 唐人街 “Chinatown”.

### *deng5(7)suan1* • 唐山 • “mainland China”

One speculative etymology for this term is that emigration from China was
primarily from coastal regions in the South, where coastal lowlands were backed
by mountain or hill ranges. Someone leaving that by ship and looking back would
hence see their homeland as a mountain across the seas.

### *huang1boin5* • 番畔 • “overseas”

In contrast to *deng5* 唐 for terms relating to China, *huang1* 番 is used for
terms related to foreign places (i.e. outside mainland China). *Huang1boin5*
refers to “foreign countries” in general; *guê3(2)huang1* 過番 means “going
abroad” or “emigrating”; a *huang1gian2* 番仔 is a foreigner.

The prefix *huang1* 番 still survives in words like *huang1ze5* 番薯 “sweet
potato” (Mandarin *fānshú*), which could be translated as “foreign yam”, as the
plant is actually native to the New World.

Loan words or code-mixing from Hokkien
--------------------------------------

### *za1bhou2* • 查某 (渣𡚸) • “woman”

This is the main word for “woman” in Hokkien, whereas in mainland Teochew it
should be *ze1niê5* 諸娘. In mainland China, *za1bhou2* has taken the meaning
of “prostitute”, similar to how Mandarin *xiáojiě* 小姐 “miss” has also come to
mean “prostitute”. However this change in meaning has not occurred in overseas
Chinese language.

### *dam7boh8* • 淡薄 • “a little bit”

The Teochew equivalent is *dih4(8)gian2* 滴仔. See [“Comparisons, degrees, and
quantity”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/comparisons.md %}).

### *bhoi6(7)sai2* • 袂使 • “may not, cannot”

The Teochew equivalent is *mo2* 孬. See
[“Negatives”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/negatives.md %})

### *pai2(6)sê3* • 歹勢 • “embarrassed”

The Teochew equivalent is *mo2(6)i3(2)se7* 孬意識, similar to the Mandarin
*bùhǎo yìshì* 不好意識.

> ai⁵³ lau³⁵sɯ³³ kaʔ² lɯ³⁵ kʰioʔ⁵ / **pʰai³⁵se²¹³** boi¹¹ pʰai³⁵se²¹³
>
> Ai3(2) lao2(6)se1 gah8(4) le2(6) kioh8, ***pai2(6)sê3*** bhoi6(7) pai2(6)sê3.
>
> 愛 老師 佮 汝 挈， ***歹勢*** 袂 歹勢。
>
> Want teacher for you take, ***embarrassing*** not embarrassing?
>
> Isn’t it embarrassing to ask the teacher to get something for you?
>
> (example from Lee, 2003)

### *bhoi6(7)pai2* • 袂歹 • “not bad”

The Teochew equivalent is *bhoi6(7)mo2* 袂孬.

> i³³ tã⁵³ tie¹¹tsiu⁵⁵ ue¹¹ tã⁵³ kaʔ² boi¹¹pʰai⁵³
>
> I1 dan3(2) Diê5(7)ziu5-uê7 dan3(2) gah8(4) bhoi6(7)pai2.
>
> 伊 呾 潮州話 呾 佮 袂歹。
>
> He speak Teochew-language speak until not-bad.
>
> He’s not bad at speaking Teochew.

Loan words from Malay
---------------------

Loan words from non-Chinese languages become assimilated to the Teochew
phonetic system: their pronunciation is modified and they acquire tones. The
following are some Malay loan words that largely retain their original
meanings:

-  kahwin - “marry”
-  mana – “where”
-  mata – “police”
-  pasar – “market”
-  pun – “also”
-  roti – “bread”
-  tapi – “but”
-  sabun - “soap”, originally from Portuguese sabão
-  sayang – “adore”
-  suka – “like”

Some loan words are not so straightforward, or have interesting stories behind
them.

### *bha7lu2* • baru • “new”

In Malay, the word “baru” can be an adjective meaning “new”:

> Tahun **baru** - “New Year”

or an adverb meaning “newly”, to mark an action that has just been completed:

> Isterinya **baru** saja beranak di hospital.
>
> Wife-his **newly** only give-birth in hospital.
>
> His wife has just given birth in hospital.
>
> (example from *Kamus Pelajar*)

In Southeast Asian Teochew, *baru* is used in the second way, as an adverb to
indicate the inceptive aspect, i.e. where something has just happened or is
starting to happen:

> ua⁵³ **ba¹¹lu³⁵** tsau³⁵kʰi⁵³
>
> Ua2 **bha7lu2(6)** zao2(6)ki2.
>
> 我 **baru** 走起。
>
> I **just** wake-up.
>
> I just woke up.

The native Teochew equivalents are *tu1tu1* 堵堵 and *ngam1ngam1* 啱啱 (see
[“Aspect and Time”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/aspect.md %})):

> ua⁵³ **tu³³tu³³** tsau³⁵kʰi⁵³
>
> Ua2 **du1du1** zao2(6)ki2.
>
> 我 **堵堵** 走起。

### *lao2(6)gung1* • 老君 • “doctor”

Derived from Malay “dukun”, meaning “witch-doctor”.

Equivalent to *ui1sêng1* 醫生 (for “doctor” in general) or *sing1sên1* 先生
(used for Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners only).

The derivative *lao2(6)gung1cu3* 老公厝 (“doctor house”) means “hospital” or
“clinic”.

### *lui1* • duit • 鐳 • “money”

A word that has gone through a chain of borrowings. Loan word from Malay
“duit”, which in turn comes from a Dutch word “duit” referring to a small coin
worth 1/160 of a guilder.

### *sig8(4)lag8* • selat • 𠰴叻 • “Singapore”

The Malay word *selat* means “straits”, and was then adopted to refer to
Singapore in particular. It has been represented in Chinese characters as 石叻
or 實叻.

### *ziah8(4)huang1* • 食風 • “to take a trip/joyride”

Calque from Malay “makan angin” (“eat wind”), meaning to take a stroll or
pleasure trip.

> i³³ naŋ¹¹ loi³⁵pai⁵⁵zik⁵ tso¹¹ tsʰia³³ kʰɯ⁵³ **tsiak²huaŋ³³**
>
> I1-nang5(7) loi2(6)bai3(5)rig8 zo6(7) cia1 ke3(2) **ziah8(4)huang1**.
>
> 伊儂 禮拜日 坐 車 去 **食風**。
>
> They Sunday sit car go **joyride**.
>
> They went out motoring on Sunday.
>
> (example from Li, 1991)

Loan words from English
-----------------------

English loan words are probably as numerous in Singapore Teochew as in any
other language spoken there, because it is the lingua franca and the main
working language of business and government.

In a sample of four conversations, Lee (2003) found that the vast majority of
loan words used were from English, of which 84% were nouns. She argues that
this means they are mostly cultural borrowings – words that are borrowed
because the other language doesn’t have a word for what the speaker wants to
express. These include place names, specialized terms related to education or
professions, and modern technology or concepts.
