Loan words and overseas Teochew language
========================================
{: .no_toc}

A substantial fraction of Teochew people live outside of mainland China. As a result their languages have diverged, and overseas Teochew has developed its own distinctive dialect terms. Here is a sample of some interesting examples, mostly from Singapore and Malaysia. Many of the examples are from Li (1991).

Local words
-----------

These words are not commonly used in mainland Teochew, or used in a different sense among overseas Teochew communities.

### *ba’4* • *bhah4* • 肉 • “meat”

The word used for “meat” on the mainland, *nek8*, is cognate to Hokkien *jiok* and Mandarin *ròu*. However, the origin of *ba'4*, which is also used in Hokkien, is unclear.

### *kong1si1* • *gong1si1* • 公司 • “shared”

Standard usage is like Mandarin, meaning “company” or “clan organization”, however in Singapore Teochew it is also used as an verb or adverb meaning “shared”.

> Tsi2ko2 mue’4kiar6 khoi’4 ning2 nor7-nang5 **kong1si1**.
>
> Zi2go2 muêh8gian6 koih4 ning2 non7-nang5 **gong1si1**.
>
> 只塊 物囝 乞 恁 兩儂 **公司**。
>
> This-piece thing give you (pl.) two-people **share**.
>
> This is for you two to share.
>
> (example from Li, 1991)

### *phang7keng1* • *pang7gêng1* • 旁宮 • “room”

The mainland pronunciation is *pang7koih1* 房間.

> Ning2 boi6 keng1 tshu7 kui6-kai7 **phang7keng1**?
>
> Ning2 bhoi6 gêng1 cu7 gui6-gai7 **pang7gêng1**?
>
> 恁 買 間 厝 幾個 **旁宮**？
>
> You (pl.) buy CL house how-many **rooms**?
>
> How many rooms are there in the house that you’ve bought?
>
> (example from Lim, 1991)

### *teung7nang5* • *deng7nang5* • 唐儂 • “ethnic Chinese”

Obsolete term in mainland Chinese, but the expression survives in Mandarin *Tángrénjiē* 唐人街 “Chinatown”.

### *teung7sua1* • *deng7sua1* • 唐山 • “mainland China”

One speculative etymology for this term is that emigration from China was primarily from coastal regions in the South, where coastal lowlands were backed by mountain or hill ranges. Someone leaving that by ship and looking back would hence see their homeland as a mountain across the seas.

### *huang1poih5* • *huang1boin5* • 番畔 • “overseas”

In contrast to *teung5* 唐 for terms relating to China, *huang1* 番 is used for terms related to foreign places (i.e. outside mainland China). *Huang1poih5* refers to “foreign countries” in general; *kue2huang1* 過番 means “going abroad” or “emigrating”; a *huang1kiar2* 番仔 is a foreigner.

The prefix *huang1* 番 still survives in words like *huang1tseu5* 番薯 “sweet potato” (Mandarin *fānshú*), which could be translated as “foreign yam”, as the plant is actually native to the New World.

Loan words or code-mixing from Hokkien
--------------------------------------

### *tsa1bou2* • *za1bhou2* • 查某 (渣𡚸) • “woman”

This is the main word for “woman” in Hokkien, whereas in mainland Teochew it should be *tseu1nie5* 諸娘. In mainland China, *tsa1bou2* has taken the meaning of “prostitute”, similar to how Mandarin *xiáojiě* 小姐 “miss” has also come to mean “prostitute”. However this change in meaning has not occurred in overseas Chinese language.

### *tam7po’8* • *dam7boh8* • 淡薄 • “a little bit”

The Teochew equivalent is *ti’8kiar2* 滴仔. See [“Comparisons, degrees, and quantity”](pages/comparisons.md).

### *boi7sai2* • *bhoi7sai2* • 袂使 • “may not, cannot”

The Teochew equivalent is *mo2* 孬. See [“Negatives”](negatives.md)

### *phai6se3* • *pai6sê3* • 歹勢 • “embarrassed”

The Teochew equivalent is *mo6i2seu7* 孬意識, similar to the Mandarin *bùhǎo yìshì* 不好意識.

> Ai2 lau6seu1 ka’4 leu6 khio’8, ***phai6se3*** boi7 phai6se3.
>
> Ai2 lao6se1 gah4 le6 kioh8, ***pai6sê3*** bhoi7 pai6sê3.
>
> 愛 老師 佮 汝 挈， ***歹勢*** 袂 歹勢。
>
> Want teacher for you take, ***embarrassing*** not embarrassing?
>
> Isn’t it embarrassing to ask the teacher to get something for you?
>
> (example from Lee, 2003)

### *boi7phai2* • *bhoi7pai2* • 袂歹 • “not bad”

The Teochew equivalent is *boi7mo2* 袂孬.

> I1 tar2 Tie7tsiu5-ue7 tar2 ka’4 boi7phai2.
>
> I1 dan2 Diê7ziu5-uê7 dan2 gah4 bhoi7pai2.
>
> 伊 呾 潮州話 呾 佮 袂歹。
>
> He speak Teochew-language speak until not-bad.
>
> He’s not bad at speaking Teochew.

Loan words from Malay
---------------------

Loan words from non-Chinese languages become assimilated to the Teochew phonetic system: their pronunciation is modified and they acquire tones. The following are some Malay loan words that largely retain their original meanings:

-  kahwin - “marry”
-  mana – “where”
-  mata – “police”
-  pasar – “market”
-  pun – “also”
-  roti – “bread”
-  tapi – “but”
-  sabun - “soap”, originally from Portuguese sabão
-  sayang – “adore”
-  suka – “like”

Some loan words are not so straightforward, or have interesting stories behind them.

### *ba7lu2* • *bha7lu2* • baru • “new”

In Malay, the word “baru” can be an adjective meaning “new”:

> Tahun **baru** - “New Year”

or an adverb meaning “newly”, to mark an action that has just been completed:

> Isterinya **baru** saja beranak di hospital.
>
> Wife-his **newly** only give-birth in hospital.
>
> His wife has just given birth in hospital.
>
> (example from *Kamus Pelajar*)

In Southeast Asian Teochew, *baru* is used in the second way, as an adverb to indicate the inceptive aspect, i.e. where something has just happened or is starting to happen:

> Ua2 **ba7lu6** tsau6khi2.
>
> Ua2 **bha7lu6** zao6ki2.
>
> 我 **baru** 走起。
>
> I **just** wake-up.
>
> I just woke up.

The native Teochew equivalents are *tu1tu1* 堵堵 and *ngam1ngam1* 啱啱 (see [“Aspect and Time”](aspect.md)):

> Ua2 **tu1tu1** tsau6khi2.
>
> Ua2 **du1du1** zao6ki2.
>
> 我 **堵堵** 走起。

### *lau6kung1* • *lao6gung1* • 老君 • “doctor”

Derived from Malay “dukun”, meaning “witch-doctor”.

Equivalent to *ui1seng1* 醫生 (for “doctor” in general) or *sin1ser1* 先生 (used for Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners only).

The derivative *lau6gung1tshu7* 老公厝 (“doctor house”) means “hospital” or “clinic”.

### *lui1* • *lui1* • duit • 鐳 • “money”

A word that has gone through a chain of borrowings. Loan word from Malay “duit”, which in turn comes from a Dutch word “duit” referring to a small coin worth 1/160 of a guilder.

### *sik4lak8* • *sig4lag8* • selat • 𠰴叻 • “Singapore”

The Malay word *selat* means “straits”, and was then adopted to refer to Singapore in particular. It has been represented in Chinese characters as 石叻 or 實叻.

### *tsiak4huang1* • *ziag4huang1* • 吃風 • “to take a trip/joyride”

Calque from Malay “makan angin” (“eat wind”), meaning to take a stroll or pleasure trip.

> I1-nang7 loi6pai5zik8 tso7 tshia1 kheu2 **tsiak4huang1**.
>
> I1-nang7 loi6bai5rig8 zo7 cia1 ke2 **ziag4huang1**.
>
> 伊儂 禮拜日 坐 車 去 **吃風**。
>
> They Sunday sit car go **joyride**.
>
> They went out motoring on Sunday.
>
> (example from Li, 1991)

Loan words from English
-----------------------

English loan words are probably as numerous in Singapore Teochew as in any other language spoken there, because it is the lingua franca and the main working language of business and government.

In a sample of four conversations, Lee (2003) found that the vast majority of loan words used were from English, of which 84% were nouns. She argues that this means they are mostly cultural borrowings – words that are borrowed because the other language doesn’t have a word for what the speaker wants to express. These include place names, specialized terms related to education or professions, and modern technology or concepts.
