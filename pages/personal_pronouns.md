Both the singular and plural personal pronouns in Teochew are largely monosyllabic, unlike Mandarin and Cantonese, where the plural personal pronouns are formed by adding a suffix to the singular pronouns, e.g. Mandarin *nǐ* 你 “you” (singular) → *nǐmen* 你們 “you” (plural) or Cantonese *ngóh* 我 “I” → *ngóhdeih* 我哋 “we”.

The Teochew plural pronouns all end in -*ng*, which may represent a long-ago fusion of the singular pronouns with a plural suffix, which was likely to have been *nang5* 儂, based on the pattern of *i1nang7* 伊儂 “they”.

### Inclusive vs. exclusive “we” – *nang2* • *nang2* • 俺 and *uang2* • *uang2* • 阮

English does not make the distinction between inclusive and exclusive “we”, unlike languages like Teochew, Mandarin (*zánmen* 咱們 / *wǒmen* 我們) and Malay (*kita* / *kami*).

Inclusive “we” includes the person being spoken to.

> **Nang2** Seng1kia1po1 kong1ming5 tso2pu7 hiang2 heung7hok8 tsing2pou7.
>
> **Nang2** Sêng1gia1bo1 gong1ming5 zo2bu7 hiang2 heng7hog8 zing2bou7.
>
> *俺* 新加坡 公民 做垺 向 幸福 進步。
>
> **We-incl.** Singapore citizens together toward happiness progress.
>
> “Mari **kita** rakyat Singapura sama-sama menuju bahagia!”

Exclusive “we” does not include the person being spoken to.

> **Uang2** thak8kiu5 tiar7tie’8 iar7kue5 ning2!
>
> **Uang2** tag8giu5 dian7diêh8 ian7guê5 ning2!
>
> *阮* 踢球 定着 贏過 恁！
>
> **We-excl.** play-ball certainly triumph-over you-pl.!
>
> We’ll trash you at football!

The variation in different pronunciations of the exclusive “we” pronoun – *uang2* / *ung2* / *ng2* – show how pronunciations can evolve by erosion.

Possessive pronouns
-------------------

The possessive pronouns are formed by adding the genitive marker *kai5* 個 to the pronouns. See [“Classifiers and kai5 個”](pages/classifiers.md).

> I1 si7 **uang2-kai7** pheng7iou2.
>
> I1 si7 **uang2-gai7** pêng7iu2.
>
> 伊 是 *阮個* 朋友。
>
> He is **our** friend.

### *uar1* • *uan1* and *nia1* • *nia1* for kinship terms

The special possessive pronouns *uar1* “my” and *nia1* “your” (both singular and plural) are used only for kinship terms.

> Nia1 hiar1 king1zik8 kheu2 ti7ko3?
>
> Nia1 hian1 ging1rig8 ke2 di7go3?
>
> ～ 兄 經日 去 哋塊？
>
> Your older-brother today go where?
>
> Where has your older brother gone today?


Reflexive pronouns
------------------

Reflexive pronouns are words that point back to a personal pronoun, e.g. “myself” or “yourself”. The personal pronoun being pointed to is known as the antecedent.

In Teochew, the reflexive pronoun is *ka1ki7* 家己, which is also written with the same characters as its Mandarin equivalent *zìjǐ* 自己.

> I1 tsie2ser1 tso7 si7 khoi’4 **ka1ki7** li7ia’4.
>
> I1 ziê2sên1 zo7 si7 koih4 **ga1gi7** li7iah4.
>
> 伊 照生 做 是 乞 家己 利益。
>
> He this-manner do is give **self** benefit.
>
> He benefits himself by doing it in this manner.

*ka1ki7* can be combined with *kai5* to form a reflexive possessive pronoun, which can be translated to English as “my/your/his/our/their own”.

> I1 tser7tser6 lo1tso2 **ka1ki7-kai7** seu7.
>
> I1 zên7zên6 lo1zo2 **ga1gi7-gai7** se7.
>
> 伊 靜靜 囉做 家己 個 事。
>
> He quietly PROG-do **self-GEN** things.
>
> He is quietly working on his own tasks.

The antecedent personal pronoun can be added to *ka1ki7* either for emphasis, or to clarify who is being referred to.

> Ua2 mai2 hueng7lo2 **i1-ka1ki7**-kai7 seu7.
>
> Ua2 mai2 huêng7lo2 **i1-ga1gi7**-gai7 se7.
>
> 我 莫 煩惱 伊家己 個 事。
>
> I don’t-want worry **himself**-GEN matter.
>
> I won’t concern myself with his own issues.

*Ka1ki7* can also function as an adverb, meaning “by oneself”. In the example below, the first *ka1ki7* is a reflexive pronoun while the second one is an adverb.

> Ka1ki7 kai7 khang1khue7 ai2 **ka1ki7** tso3.
>
> Ga1gi7 gai7 kang1kuê7 ai2 **ga1gi7** zo3.
>
> 家己 個 工課 愛 家己 做。
>
> Self-REL tasks ought **self** do.
>
> One’s own tasks should be done by oneself.
