Both the singular and plural personal pronouns in Teochew are largely
monosyllabic, unlike Mandarin and Cantonese, where the plural personal pronouns
are formed by adding a suffix to the singular pronouns, e.g. Mandarin *nǐ* 你
“you” (singular) → *nǐmen* 你們 “you” (plural) or Cantonese *ngóh* 我 “I” →
*ngóhdeih* 我哋 “we”.

The Teochew plural pronouns all end in -*ng*, which may represent a long-ago
fusion of the singular pronouns with a plural suffix, which was likely to have
been *nang5* 儂, based on the pattern of *i1nang7* 伊儂 “they”.

### Inclusive vs. exclusive “we” – *nang2* • 俺 and *uang2* • 阮

English does not make the distinction between inclusive and exclusive “we”,
unlike languages like Teochew, Mandarin (*zánmen* 咱們 / *wǒmen* 我們) and
Malay (*kita* / *kami*).

Inclusive “we” includes the person being spoken to.

> **naŋ⁵³** seŋ³³kia³³po³³ koŋ³³miŋ⁵⁵ tso⁵³bu¹¹ hiaŋ⁵³ hɯŋ¹¹hok⁵ tsiŋ⁵³pou¹¹
>
> **Nang2** Sêng1gia1bo1 gong1ming5 zo3(2)bhu5(7) hiang3(2) heng6(7)hog8 zing3(2)bou7.
>
> *俺* 新加坡 公民 做垺 向 幸福 進步。
>
> **We-incl.** Singapore citizens together toward happiness progress.
>
> “Mari **kita** rakyat Singapura sama-sama menuju bahagia!”

Exclusive “we” does not include the person being spoken to.

> **uaŋ⁵³** tʰak⁵kiu⁵⁵ tĩã¹¹tieʔ⁵ ĩã¹¹kue⁵⁵ niŋ⁵³
>
> **Uang2** tag4(8)giu5 dian6(7)diêh8 ian5(7)guê3(5) ning2!
>
> *阮* 踢球 定着 贏過 恁！
>
> **We-excl.** play-ball certainly triumph-over you-pl.!
>
> We’ll trash you at football!

The variation in different pronunciations of the exclusive “we” pronoun –
*uang2* / *ung2* / *ng2* – show how pronunciations can evolve by erosion.

Possessive pronouns
-------------------

The possessive pronouns are formed by adding the genitive marker *gai5* 個 to
the pronouns. See
[“Classifiers and gai5 個”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/classifiers.md %}).

> i³³ si¹¹ **uaŋ⁵³ kai¹¹** pʰeŋ¹¹iou⁵³
>
> I1 si6(7) **uang2-gai5(7)** pêng5(7)iu2.
>
> 伊 是 *阮個* 朋友。
>
> He is **our** friend.

### *uan1* and *nia1* for kinship terms

The special possessive pronouns *uan1* “my” and *nia1* “your” (both singular
and plural) are used only for kinship terms.

> **nia³³** hĩã³³ kiŋ³³zik⁵ kʰɯ⁵³ ti¹¹ko²¹³
>
> **Nia1** hian1 ging1rig8 ke3(2) di7go3?
>
> *～* 兄 經日 去 哋塊？
>
> **Your** older-brother today go where?
>
> Where has your older brother gone today?


Reflexive pronouns
------------------

Reflexive pronouns are words that point back to a personal pronoun, e.g.
“myself” or “yourself”. The personal pronoun being pointed to is known as the
antecedent.

In Teochew, the reflexive pronoun is *ga1gi7* 家己, which is also written with
the same characters as its Mandarin equivalent *zìjǐ* 自己.

> i³³ tsie⁵³sẽ³³ tso²¹³ si¹¹ kʰoiʔ² **ka³³ki¹¹** li¹¹iaʔ²
>
> I1 ziê3(2)sên1 zo3 si6(7) koih4 **ga1gi7** li6(7)iah4.
>
> 伊 照生 做 是 乞 *家己* 利益。
>
> He this-manner do is give **self** benefit.
>
> He benefits himself by doing it in this manner.

*ga1gi7* can be combined with *gai5* to form a reflexive possessive pronoun,
which can be translated to English as “my/your/his/our/their own”.

> i³³ tsẽ¹¹tsẽ³⁵ lo³³tso⁵³ **ka³³ki¹¹ kai¹¹** sɯ¹¹
>
> I1 zên6(7)zên6 lo1zo3(2) **ga1gi7-gai5(7)** se7.
>
> 伊 靜靜 囉做 *家己 個* 事。
>
> He quietly PROG-do **self-GEN** things.
>
> He is quietly working on his own tasks.

The antecedent personal pronoun can be added to *ga1gi7* either for emphasis,
or to clarify who is being referred to.

> ua⁵³ mai⁵³ hueŋ¹¹lo⁵³ **i³³ ka³³ki¹¹** kai¹¹ sɯ¹¹
>
> Ua2 mai3(2) huêng5(7)lo2 **i1-ga1gi7**-gai5(7) se7.
>
> 我 莫 煩惱 *伊家己* 個 事。
>
> I don’t-want worry **himself**-GEN matter.
>
> I won’t concern myself with his own issues.

*Ga1gi7* can also function as an adverb, meaning “by oneself”. In the example
below, the first *ga1gi7* is a reflexive pronoun while the second one is an
adverb.

> ka³³ki¹¹ kai¹¹ kʰaŋ³³kʰue¹¹ ai⁵³ **ka³³ki¹¹** tso²¹³
>
> Ga1gi7 gai5(7) kang1kuê7 ai3(2) **ga1gi7** zo3.
>
> 家己 個 工課 愛 *家己* 做。
>
> Self-REL tasks ought **self** do.
>
> One’s own tasks should be done by oneself.
