Sentence final particles and interjections
==========================================
{: .no_toc}

Sentence final particles, also known as “utterance particles”, are a typical
feature of Chinese languages, but they are challenging to learn and to analyze
because of their protean flexibility. They are typically monosyllabic, and are
applied to the ends of phrases, clauses, or sentences to lend different shades
of meaning, attitude, or emotion, but the particle does not have a specific
semantic meaning by itself. Cantonese in particular has a rich variety of such
particles, but Teochew also has a good number of them.

They are not as well researched as other aspects of Teochew grammar, so the
descriptions here are tentative, and mostly based on transcribed speech
examples. The examples given here are largely taken from Singaporean Teochew
usage, and may not be representative of Teochew spoken elsewhere.

Sentence final particles
------------------------

### no7 • 二 • emphasis

According to Li (1959), this particle is used for entreaties, persuasion, and
rhetorical questions. Furthermore, he states that a slight falling intonation
vs. a flat low tone (tone 7) distinguishes a simple acknowledgement and an
emphasis respectively. His example was:

> ua⁵³ tsai³³ **no¹¹**
>
> Ua2 zai1 **no**.
>
> 我 知 **二**.
>
> I know **SFP**.

I know (slight falling intonation)
vs. I definitely know (flat low tone)

Emphasis can be used to confirm something that had been put to the speaker in a
question. In the following example, the speaker has just been asked if the
Speak Mandarin Campaign in Singapore had an influence on the recruitment of new
actors to his Teochew opera troupe:

> oi³⁵ **no¹¹** / oi³⁵ **no¹¹** / u¹¹ ĩã³⁵hiaŋ⁵³ **no¹¹**
>
> Oi6 **no7**, oi6 **no7**, u6(7) ian2(6)hiang3(2) **no7**
>
> 會**no7**，會**no7**，有 影響 **二**
>
> Can **SFP**, can **SFP**, have influence **SFP**
>
> Yes, yes, there has indeed been an influence
>
> [*Interview with Chua Hong Kee*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/texts/chua_hong_kee.md %})

*no7* can also indicate that the speaker has just realized or recognized a
fact, or wishes to acknowledge it. In the following example, the speaker is
skeptical that his conversation partner is able to say something in English.

> si¹¹ lɯ⁵³ boi¹¹hiau³⁵ ek⁵ **no¹¹**
>
> Si6(7) le2 bhoi6(7)hiao2(6) êg8 **no7**.
>
> 是 汝 袂曉 譯 **二**。
>
> Is you NEG-able translate **SFP**.
>
> So you don’t know how to translate it, after all?
>
> [*Wang Sa & Ye Fong – Comedy Sketch*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/texts/wang_sa_ye_fong.md %})

Li (1959) writes this word with a character consisting of a mouth radical 口
and the number two 二, because it is pronounced like 二 *no6*. However this
character is not available in Unicode, so it is substituted here with the
character 二.

### ho2 • 好 • seeking confirmation

When the speaker wants an acknowledgement or confirmation from the other party,
and the sentence is not phrased as a question. Also used rhetorically.

> lɯ⁵³ mũã³⁵zik⁵ ai⁵³ lai⁵⁵ **ho⁵³**
>
> Le2 muan2(6)rig8 ai3(2) lai5 **ho2**!
>
> 汝 ～日 愛 來 **好**！
>
> You tomorrow want come **SFP**!
>
> You have to come tomorrow!
>
> \*\*\*
>
> lɯ⁵³ mai⁵³ si⁵³sua⁵³ lai⁵⁵ **ho⁵³**
>
> Le2 mai3(2) si3(2)sua2 lai5 **ho2**!
>
> 汝 莫 四散 來 **好**！
>
> You NEG slipshod come **SFP**!
>
> Don’t try to pull any tricks

### a1 • ～ • emphasis

>

To emphasize the subject or topic of the sentence:

> lai¹¹ tsʰe³³ lou¹¹ / hũã¹¹ lau³³ lɯ²¹³

>

> I1 dian6(7)diêh8 oi6 gai7 **ma**
>

### nê5/7 呢/呤 • emphasis

Indicates a pause, to emphasize the subject or topic of the sentence.

> naŋ⁵³ seŋ³³kia³³po¹¹ **ne⁵⁵** / si¹¹ to³³naŋ⁵⁵ tsoŋ³⁵tsok⁵ kai¹¹ sia¹¹hue³⁵
>

It can also contrast a phrase or a clause with another one preceding it. In the
following example, the first *nê5* reinforces *bug4(8)guê3* “however”. The
second *nê5* emphasizes the contrast in the *u6(7)gai5*… *u6(7)gai5*… pair
(“some are …, some others are …”).

> puk²kue²¹³ **ne³³** / naŋ⁵³ tɯŋ¹¹naŋ⁵⁵ kai¹¹ ue¹¹ na³³ / u¹¹ kai⁵⁵ ho³⁵
