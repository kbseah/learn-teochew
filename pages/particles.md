Sentence final particles and interjections
==========================================
{: .no_toc}

Sentence final particles, also known as “utterance particles”, are a typical feature of Chinese languages, but they are challenging to learn and to analyze because of their protean flexibility. They are typically monosyllabic, and are applied to the ends of phrases, clauses, or sentences to lend different shades of meaning, attitude, or emotion, but the particle does not have a specific semantic meaning by itself. Cantonese in particular has a rich variety of such particles, but Teochew also has a good number of them.

They are not as well researched as other aspects of Teochew grammar, so the descriptions here are tentative, and mostly based on transcribed speech examples. The examples given here are largely taken from Singaporean Teochew usage, and may not be representative of Teochew spoken elsewhere.

Sentence final particles
------------------------

### no7 • no7 • 二 • emphasis

According to Li (1959), this particle is used for entreaties, persuasion, and rhetorical questions. Furthermore, he states that a slight falling intonation vs. a flat low tone (tone 7) distinguishes a simple acknowledgement and an emphasis respectively. His example was:

> Ua2 tsai1 **no**.
>
> Ua2 zai1 **no**.
>
> 我 知 **二**.
>
> I know **SFP**.

I know (slight falling intonation)
vs. I definitely know (flat low tone)

Emphasis can be used to confirm something that had been put to the speaker in a question. In the following example, the speaker has just been asked if the Speak Mandarin Campaign in Singapore had an influence on the recruitment of new actors to his Teochew opera troupe:

> Oi6 **no7**, oi6 **no7**, u7 iar6hiang2 **no7**
>
> Oi6 **no7**, oi6 **no7**, u7 ian6hiang2 **no7**
>
> 會**no7**，會**no7**，有 影響 **二**
>
> Can **SFP**, can **SFP**, have influence **SFP**
>
> Yes, yes, there has indeed been an influence
>
> [*Interview with Chua Hong Kee*](texts/chua_hong_kee.md)

*no7* can also indicate that the speaker has just realized or recognized a fact, or wishes to acknowledge it. In the following example, the speaker is skeptical that his conversation partner is able to say something in English.

> Si7 leu2 boi7hiau6 ek8 **no7**.
>
> Si7 le2 bhoi7hiao6 êg8 **no7**.
>
> 是 汝 袂曉 譯 **二**。
>
> Is you NEG-able translate **SFP**.
>
> So you don’t know how to translate it, after all?
>
> [*Wang Sa & Ye Fong – Comedy Sketch*](texts/wang_sa_ye_fong.md)

Li (1959) writes this word with a character consisting of a mouth radical 口 and the number two 二, because it is pronounced like 二 *no6*. However this character is not available in Unicode, so it is substituted here with the character 二.

### ho2 • ho2 • 好 • seeking confirmation

When the speaker wants an acknowledgement or confirmation from the other party, and the sentence is not phrased as a question. Also used rhetorically.

> Leu2 muar6zik8 ai2 lai5 **ho2**!
>
> Le2 muan6rig8 ai2 lai5 **ho2**!
>
> 汝 ～日 愛 來 **好**！
>
> You tomorrow want come **SFP**!
>
> You have to come tomorrow!
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Leu2 mai2 si2sua2 lai5 **ho2**!
>
> Le2 mai2 si2sua2 lai5 **ho2**!
>
> 汝 莫 四散 來 **好**！
>
> You NEG slipshod come **SFP**!
>
> Don’t try to pull any tricks

### a1 • a1 • ～ • emphasis

At the end of entire sentence as emphasis.

> tiang7nau2 long6tsong2 khoi’4-i1 puar1puar1 kheu7 ***a***!

>

### ne5/7 • nê5/7 呢/呤 • emphasis

It can also contrast a phrase or a clause with another one preceding it. In the following example, the first *ne5* reinforces *puk4kue3* “however”. The second *ne5* emphasizes the contrast in the *u7kai5*… *u7kai5*… pair (“some are …, some others are …”).

> Puk4kue3 **ne1**, nang2 teung7nang5 kai7 ue7 na1, u7-kai5 ho6 thiar1, u7-kai5 **ne1** iou6 m7-ho6-thiar1.
>
> Bug4guê3 **nê1**, nang2 deng7nang5 gai7 uê7 na, u7-gai5 ho6-tian1, u7-gai5 **nê1** iou6 m7-ho6-tian1.
