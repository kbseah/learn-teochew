The number system
-----------------

The number system in Teochew is like other Chinese languages: counting is in base-ten, and there is a special name for ten-thousand, *buang7* 萬. A million would hence be *tsek4pe’8buang7* 一百萬 “one hundred ten-thousand”.[^1]

### *tsek8 / ik8* • *zêg8 / ig8* • “one”  and *no6 / zi6* • *no6 / ri6* • “two”

Teochew has two different words each for “one” and “two”. Compare the situation in Mandarin where there are two words for “two”: *èr* 二 and *liǎng* 兩.

*Tsek8* 一 “one” and *no6* 兩 “two” are used when counting off the numbers in sequence and for counting things (cardinal numbers):

> **tsek8**-pung2 tshe’4
>
> **zêg8**-bung2 cêh4
>
> **一**本 冊
>
> **one**-CL book
>
> a book
>
> \*\*\*
>
> **no7**-tiou5 heu5
>
> **no7**-diou5 he5
>
> **兩**條 魚
>
> **two**-CL fish
>
> two fish

*ik8* 一 “one\*” and *zi6* 二 “two\*” are used under the following circumstances:

(a) As part of numbers above ten

> tsap4**ik8**
>
> zap4**ig8**
>
> 十**一**
>
> ten **one\***
>
> eleven
>
> \*\*\*
>
> **zi7**tsap4**ik8**
>
> **ri7**zab4**ig8**
>
> **二**十**一**
>
> **two\*** ten **one\***
>
> twenty-one

Except for one-hundred, two-hundred, one-thousand, two-thousand, etc. and their compounds.

> **tsek8**-pe’4-zi7tsap4ik8
>
> **zig8**-beh4-ri7zab4ig8
>
> **一**百二十一
>
> **one** hundred two\* ten one\*
>
> one hundred and twenty-one
>
> \*\*\*
>
> **no7**-tshoih1-**no7**-pe’4-zi7tsap4zi6
>
> **no7**-coin1-**no7**-bêh4-ri7zap4ri6
>
> **兩** 千 **兩** 百二十二
>
> **two** thousand **two** hundred one\* ten two\*
>
> two thousand two hundred and twelve

This is similar to Mandarin, where 2222 would be *liǎngqiān-liángbǎi-èrshí-èr*. However, in Mandarin, *èr* 二 is used in counting from one to ten, instead of *liǎng* 兩.

(b) To denote the order of things (ordinal numbers), e.g. in ranks and dates

> toih7-**zi6**
>
> doin7-**ri6**
>
> 第**二**
>
> rank **two\***
>
> second
>
> \*\*\*
>
> **zi7**-tsek4
>
> **ri7**-zêg4
>
> **二**叔
>
> **two\*** uncle
>
> Second Uncle (father’s younger brother)

For familial terms, the eldest relation of a given rank is denoted by *tua7* 大 instead of *ik8* 一, e.g. *tua7kou1* 大姑 “father’s eldest sister”. The youngest relation is denoted by *soi3* 細, e.g. *soi2kou1 *“father’s youngest sister”.

### Reciting number strings

When reciting strings of numbers, such as telephone numbers, *khang1* (“null”) is often used in place of *leng5*, and *iou1* (“one^”) in place of *tsek8*.

> I1-kai7 tiang7ue7 ho7be2 si7 tshik4-**iou1**-**iou1**-**khang1**-tshik4-ngou6.
>
> I1-gai7 diang7ue7 ho7bhê2 si7 cik4-**iou1**-**iou1**-**kang1**-cik4-ngou6.
>
> 伊個 電話 號碼 是 七幺幺空七五。
>
> He-CL telephone number is seven **one^** **one^** **null** seven five.
>
> His telephone number is 711075.

### *tuar1* • *duan1* and *leng5* • *lêng5* as placeholders for zeroes

In numbers above one hundred, zeroes in the tens, hundreds, etc. places can be filled in with placeholder words. *Tuar1* is only used for the tens place, while *leng5* is used for the rest.

> no7tshoih1-**leng7tuar1**-ik4
>
> no7coin1-**leng7duan1**-ig4
>
> 兩千**零單**一
>
> two thousand **zero \[placeholder\]** one\*
>
> two oh-oh one

Telling time
------------

### Times of day

| Definition    | Flattened IPA | Peng’im   | Character |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| day time      | zik8kua1      | rig8gua1  | 日～      |
| night time    | mer5kua1      | mên5gua1  | 暝～      |
| morning, dawn | meng7khi2     | mêng7ki2  | 眠起      |
| forenoon      | tsier5kua3    | ziên5     | 前～      |
| noon          | zik4tau3      | rig4dao3  | 日晝      |
| afternoon     | e7kua3        | ê7gua3    | 下～      |
| dusk          | mer7hng1      | mên7hng1  | 暝昏      |
| night         | zik8am3       | rig8am3   | 日暗      |
| midnight      | puar2mer5     | buan2mên5 | 半暝      |

Before the adoption of modern timekeeping, the passing of time at night was marked in Chinese cities by the night watch. The night was subdivided into five equal “watches” *ker1* 更, which were announced by a drum or gong.[^2] This is the origin of the phrase *sar1ker1-pua2mer5* 三更半夜 “in the dead of night”.

### Reading the clock

Hours of the clock (o’clock) are represented by \[number\] + *tiam2* 點. Add *puar3* 半 for half-past the hour. Classifiers are not necessary.

> sar1-**tiam2**
>
> san1-**diam2**
>
> 三**點**
>
> three **hour**
>
> three o’clock
>
> \*\*\*
>
> sar1-**tiam5**-**puar3**
>
> san1-**diam5**-**buan3**
>
> 三**點半**
>
> three **hour** **half**
>
> half-past three

For one and two o’clock, use *tsek8* 一 “one” and *no6* 兩 “two” respectively, rather than *ik4* and *zi6* 二. However, *zi7tiam2* “two o’clock” is idiomatic in Hokkien.

*Tiam2* 點 is related to *tiam5tseng5* 點鐘 “hour”, however, a phrase like *sar1-tiam5tseng5* 三點鐘 would refer to the duration of time of three hours, rather than three o’clock.

To distinguish between a.m. and p.m., qualify the clock time with the phase of the day.

> **mung7khi2** tshik8tiam2
>
> **mung7ki2** cig8diam2
>
> **眠起** 七點
>
> **morning** seven-hour
>
> seven a.m.
>
> \*\*\*
>
> **me7hng1** tshik8tiam2
>
> **mê7hng1** cig8diam2
>
> **暝昏** 七點
>
> **evening** seven-hour
>
> seven p.m.

In addition to the bottom of the hour, the hour is subdivided into five-minute intervals, *zi7* 字, corresponding to the markings on a clockface. *zi7* must be used with the classifier *kai5* 個.

> tshik8tiam2 tshik8-kai7-**zi7**
>
> cig8diam2 cig8-gai7-**ri7**
>
> 七點 七個**字**
>
> seven-hour seven-CL **mark**
>
> seven thirty-five

When asking the time, use the interrogative for countable “how many” *kui2* 幾:

> tsi2tsung5 **kui6**-tiam2? tsi2tsung5 tshik8tiam2 sar1-kai7-zi7.
>
> zi2zung5 **gui6**-diam2? zi2zung5 cig8diam2 san1-gai7-ri7.
>
> 只陣 **幾** 點？只陣 七點 三個字。
>
> now **\[how-many\]**-hour? now seven-hour three-CL mark.
>
> What time is it? It’s seven fifteen.

The word for “minutes”, *hung1tseng1* 分鐘, uses the literary pronunciation of 分 rather than the vernacular *bung1*.

Dates and the calendar
----------------------

### Basic terms

| Definition | Flattened IPA | Peng’im  | Character |
|------------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Year       | ni5           | ni5      | 年        |
| Month      | gue’8         | ghuêh8   | 月        |
| Week       | loi6pai3      | loi6bai3 | 禮拜      |

| Day        | zik8          | rig8     | 日        |

The basic terminology and patterning is similar to Mandarin. Calendar dates are reported in the order year-month-day. The number comes before the unit, and *ho7* 號 (“number”) is used in place of *zik8* 日 for “day”.

> zi7khang2iou1poi’4-ni5 sar1-gue’8 poi’4-**ho7**
>
> ri7kang2iou1boih4-ni5 san1-ghuêh8 boih4-**ho7**
>
> 二空幺八年 三月 八**號**
>
> two-null-one^-eight-year three-month eight-**number**
>
> 8 March 2018

### Days of the week

Days of the week from Monday (1) to Saturday (6) are reported in the format *pai6* 拜 + \[number\]; Sunday is *loi6pai3* 禮拜 or *loi6pai3zik8* 禮拜日. For Monday and Tuesday, use the ordinal *ik4* and *zi6* instead of *tsek8* and *no6*.

### Relative terms

The following terms are used to refer to dates relative to the present:

| Definition           | Flattened IPA       | Peng’im            | Character |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| today                | king1zik8           | ging1rig8          | 經日      |

| day before yesterday | tshiar6zik8         | cian6rig8          | 前日      |
| day before yesterday | teng6zik8           | dêng6rig8          | 頂日      |
| tomorrow             | muar2khi2           | muan2ki2           | ～起      |
| tomorrow             | muar2zik8           | muan2rig8          | ～日      |

| next Monday          | e7kai7 pai2ik4      | ê7gai7 bai2ig4     | 下個 拜一 |
| this year            | king1ni5            | ging1ni5           | 經年      |
| next year            | mer7ni5             | mên7ni5            | 夜年      |
| last year            | ku7ni5              | gu7ni5             | 舊年      |

In addition to words for “today”, “yesterday”, and “tomorrow”, there are specific words for “the day after tomorrow” and “the day before yesterday”, just as in Mandarin.

For weeks and months, the generic adjectives *tsi2kai5* 只個 (“this”+CL) and *e7kai5* 下個 (“next”+CL) are used instead of adjectives specifically used for times/dates like *king1* 經, which are used with days and years, e.g. *king1zik8* 經日 (“today”).

With the exception of *king1* 經 (“present”), the adjectives used for relative days and years are not the same.

*Muar2* in *muar2zik8* ～日 (“tomorrow”) and *mer7* in *mer7ni5* 夜年 (“next year”) may sometimes be written with the same character 明 for semantic reasons.

Terms containing *zik8* 日 “day” can be substituted with *mer5* 夜 “night”, e.g. *muar2zik8* 明日 “tomorrow”→ *muar2mer5* 明夜 “tomorrow night”.

Counting money
--------------

The native Teochew word for “money” is *tsih5* 錢, cognate with Mandarin *qián*. In Southeast Asia, *lui5* 鐳 is more commonly used, deriving from Malay *duit* “money”/“cash”. The Malay word was, in turn, derived from Dutch *duit*, which was a type of coin worth 1/160 of a guilder.

| Definition  | Flattened IPA | Peng’im | Character |
|-------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| dollar      | ngeung5    | ngeng5    | 銀       |
| dollar      | khou1      | kou1      | 箍       |
| dollar (CL) | kai5       | gai5      | 個       |
| ten cents   | hau5(tsi2) | hao5(zi2) | 毫（子）  |
| ten cents   | kak4       | gag4      | 角       |
| cent        | hung1      | hung1     | 分       |
| cent        | tsam1      | zam1      | 針       |

The basic pattern is “NUMBER + UNIT” from the largest to smallest unit, for example:

> Sar1-kai7-ngeung5 lak4-hau5 tshek4-tsam1
>
> San1-gai7-ngeng5 lag4-hao5 cêk4-zam1
>
> 三個銀 六毫 七針
>
> Three-CL-dollars six-dimes seven-cents
>
> $3.67

The series *ngeung5-hao5-hung1* 銀毫分 is used in mainland China, whereas the series *khou1-kak4-tsam1* 塊角針 is more prevalent in overseas Chinese usage.

> *Ngeung5* 銀 is used with the classifier *kai5* 個:
>
> Ngou7-kai7-**ngeung5**
>
> Ngou7-gai7-**ngeng5**
>
> 五個 **銀**
>
> five-CL **dollars**
>
> $5

By extension, *kai5* can be used alone to mean “dollar”:

> Ngou7-**kai5** lak4-hau5
>
> Ngou7-**gai5** lag4-hao5
>
> 五**個** 六毫
>
> Five-**dollars** six-dimes
>
> $5.60

In contrast, *khou1* is usually used without a classifier:

> Ngou7**khou1** – ngou7**kou1** – 五**箍** – five **dollars** – $5

Or it can be used as a classifier for *ngeung5*:

> Ngou7**khou1**-ngeung5 – ngou7**kou1**-ngeng5 – 五箍 銀 – five **dollars** of money – $5

*Ngeung5* also means “silver”, and is part of compound words like *ngeung7hang5* 銀行 “bank”.

*Puar3* 半 “half” can follow a unit to mean half that unit, just like in telling the time (see above):

> Ngou7-khou1-**puar3**
>
> Ngou7-kou1-**buan3**
>
> 五箍**半**
>
> Five-dollars-**half**
>
> $5.50

“$5.50” can also be expressed as *ngou7khou1-ngou7kak4* 五箍 五角.

> Ngou7-khou1 ngou7-kak4 **puar3**
>
> Ngou7kou1 ngou7gag4 **buan3**
>
> 五箍 五角 **半**
>
> Five-dollars five-dimes-**half**
>
> $5.55

“$5.55” can also be expressed as *ngou7khou1-ngou7kak4-ngou7tsam1* 五箍 五角 五針.
