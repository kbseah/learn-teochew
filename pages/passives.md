Passives and “give” constructions
=================================
{: .no_toc}

The passive voice in Teochew uses the same words that mean “to give”, so these
two topics are treated together here.

Passive
-------

The passive markers in Teochew are *koih4* (also pronounced *kêh4*) 乞 or
*bung1* 分. The latter is characteristic of the dialect spoken in Swatow, but
the two can be used interchangeably. The passive marker in Hokkien is *hōo/hǒ*
予 (also written 與); here Teochew has more in common with Northern Min, which
use cognates of *koih4* 乞.

The basic construction is:

> \[object\] PASS \[agent\] \[verb\]
>
> tsʰɯŋ¹¹teŋ⁵³ kai¹¹ pĩã⁵³ loŋ³⁵tsoŋ⁵³ **kʰoiʔ²** nou³³kĩã⁵³ tsiaʔ⁵kʰɯ¹¹ lou¹¹
>
> Ceng5(7)dêng2-gai5(7) bian2 long2(6)zong2 **koih4** nou1gian2 ziah8-ke3 lou7.
>
> 床頂 個 餅 攏總 *乞* 奴仔 食去 路。
>
> Table-top-REL biscuits all **PASS** children eat-away-PERF.
>
> The biscuits on the table have all been eaten by the children.
>
> \*\*\*
>
> i³³ **puŋ³³** lui¹¹koŋ³³ kʰa⁵³si⁵³
>
> I1 **bung1** lui6(7)gong1 ka3(2)si2.
>
> 伊 *分* 雷公 扣死。
>
> He **PASS** lightning struck-dead.
>
> He was struck dead by lightning. (Lim 1886, pg. 47)

The passive marker is thought to have evolved from the verb “to give” via the
related sense of “to allow” (see “‘Give’ constructions” below, and Xu 2007
chapter 8).

> **kʰoiʔ²** a³³ meŋg⁵⁵ tso¹¹ kai¹¹ pĩã⁵³ tsiŋ³³sik⁵ bo¹¹ho³⁵tsiaʔ⁵
>
> **Koih4** A1Mêng5 zo6(7)-gai5(7) bian2 zing1sig8 bho5(7)ho2(6)ziah8.
>
> *乞* 阿明 做 個 餅 真實 無好食。
>
> **PASS** Ah-Meng make REL biscuits really NEG-good-eat.
>
> The biscuits made by Ah Meng are really terrible. (Interpretation 1: Passive)
>
> The biscuits that Ah Meng was tasked to make are really terrible. [^1] (Interpretation 2: Passive + sense of “give”)

The example above also shows how the passive can be used in a relative clause
with the relative marker *gai5* 個.

### *koih4nang5* • 乞儂 • Use of a generic agent

*Koih4* or *bung1* cannot be used without an agent, e.g. English “I was given a
basket of pears.” The question “by whom?” is not answered by such an
“agentless” passive form, making it a common construction in unclear or evasive
speech.

In Teochew, the passive must always be accompanied by an agent. Where none is
forthcoming, a dummy or generic agent can be used: *nang5* 儂 (“person”) in
*koih4nang5* 乞儂 or *bung1nang5* 分儂.

This is unlike Mandarin, where the passive marker *bèi* 被 can be used without
an agent:

> Nàge xiǎotōu **bèi** zhuō le.
>
> 那個 小偷 *被* 捉 了。
>
> That thief **PASS** catch PERF.
>
> That thief has been caught. \[By whom?\]

The analogous construction would be ungrammatical in Teochew:

> \* hɯ⁵³kai¹¹ tsʰɯ³⁵tsʰak²kĩã⁵³ **kʰoiʔ²** liaʔ⁵ liou²¹³
>
> \* He2gai5(7) ce2(6)cag8(4)kian2 **koih4** liah8 liou3.
>
> \* 許個 鼠賊囝 *乞* 掠 了。
>
> \* That-CL thief **PASS** catch PERF.

Instead it requires a dummy agent:

> hɯ⁵³kai¹¹ tsʰɯ³⁵tsʰak²kĩã⁵³ **kʰoiʔ²naŋ¹¹** liaʔ⁵ liou²¹³
>
> He2gai5(7) ce2(6)cag8(4)gian2 **koih4nang5(7)** liah8 liou3.
>
> 許個 鼠賊囝 *乞儂* 掠 了。
>
> That-CL thief **PASS-person** catch PERF.
>
> That thief has been caught by someone.


Uses of *koih4* and *bung1*
---------------------------

Aside from marking the passive voice, the words *koih4* and *bung1* can be used
as a straightforward verb for “to give” and a number of other functions.

### “To give”

> ua⁵³ **kʰoiʔ²** i³³ tsek² puŋ³⁵ tsɯ³³
>
> Ua2 **koih4** i1 zêg8(4)-bung2(6) ze1.
>
> 我 *乞* 伊 一本 書。
>
> I **give** he one-CL book.
>
> I give him a book.

### “To allow”

> ua⁵³ tsi³⁵pai⁵³ **kʰoiʔ²** lɯ³⁵ zip⁵lai¹¹ / e¹¹pai⁵³ tsu¹¹ mo⁵³
>
> Ua2 zi2(6)bai2 **koih4** le2(6) rib4(8)lai7, e6(7)bai2 zu6(7) mo2.
>
> 我 只擺 *乞* 汝 進來, 下擺 就 孬。
>
> I this-time **allow** you enter, next-time then not-able.
>
> I’ll let you come in this time, but not the next time.

### “For” or “to”

> ua⁵³ kʰioʔ⁵ lai¹¹ **kʰoiʔ²** lɯ³⁵ tʰoiʔ⁵³
>
> Ua2 kioh8-lai5(7) **koih4** le2(6) toin2.
>
> 我 挈來 *乞* 汝 睇。
>
> I take-here for you see.
>
> I’ll bring it here for you to see.

> \*\*\*

> ua⁵³ **kʰoiʔ²** lɯ³⁵ tso¹¹ kai¹¹ kʰaŋ³³kʰue¹¹
>
> Ua2 **koih4** le2(6) zo6(7)-gai5(7) kang1kuê7
>
> 我 乞 汝 做個 工課
>
> I for you do-REL work
>
> The work that I did for you

In Hokkien, the word *kā* 共 is used for the senses of “for”, “to”, “with”,
e.g. *guá kā lí kóng* “let me tell you...”.

### “Give” with *sang3*

Unlike *koih4* / *bung1*, the verb *sang3* 送 can be used in the sense of “to
give” but not the other functions that *koih4* / *bung1* have.

> Ua2 **sang3(2)** le2(6) zêg8(4)-bung2(6) ze1.

> \* Ua2 zi2(6)bai2 **sang3(2)** le2(6) rib4(8)lai.

> \* Ua2 kioh8-lai5(7) **sang3(2)** le2(6) toin2.
