Passives and “give” constructions
=================================
{: .no_toc}

The passive voice in Teochew uses the same words that mean “to give”, so these two topics are treated together here.

Passive
-------

The passive markers in Teochew are *khoi’4* (also pronounced *khe’4*) 乞 or *pung1* 分. The latter is characteristic of the dialect spoken in Swatow, but the two can be used interchangeably. The passive marker in Hokkien is *hōo/hǒ* 予 (also written 與); here Teochew has more in common with Northern Min, which use cognates of *khoi’4* 乞.

The basic construction is:

> \[object\] PASS \[agent\] \[verb\]
>
> Tsheung7deng2-kai7 piar2 long6tsong2 **khoi’4** nou1kiar2 tsia’8-kheu7 lou7.
>
> Ceng7dêng2-gai7 bian2 long6zong2 **khoih4** nou1gian2 ziah8-ke7 lou7.
>
> 床頂 個 餅 攏總 **乞** 奴仔 食去 路。
>
> Table-top-REL biscuits all **PASS** children eat-away-PERF.
>
> The biscuits on the table have all been eaten by the children.
>
> \*\*\*
>
> I1 **pung1** lui7kong1 kha2si2.
>
> I1 **bung1** lui7gong1 ka2si2.
>
> 伊 **分** 雷公 扣死。
>
> He **PASS** lightning struck-dead.
>
> He was struck dead by lightning. (Lim 1886, pg. 47)

The passive marker is thought to have evolved from the verb “to give” via the related sense of “to allow” (see “‘Give’ constructions” below, and Xu 2007 chapter 8).

> **Khoi’4** A1Meng5 tso7-kai7 piar2 tsing1sik8 bo7ho6tsia’2.
>
> **Koih4** A1Mêng5 zo7-gai7 bian2 zing1sig8 bho7ho6ziah2.
>
> **乞** 阿明 做 個 餅 真實 無好食。
>
> **PASS** Ah-Meng make REL biscuits really NEG-good-eat.
>
> The biscuits made by Ah Meng are really terrible. (Interpretation 1: Passive)
>
> The biscuits that Ah Meng was tasked to make are really terrible. [^1] (Interpretation 2: Passive + sense of “give”)

The example above also shows how the passive can be used in a relative clause with the relative marker *kai5* 個.

### khoi’4nang5 乞儂 – Use of a generic agent

*Khoi’4* or *pung1* cannot be used without an agent, e.g. English “I was given a basket of pears.” The question “by whom?” is not answered by such an “agentless” passive form, making it a common construction in unclear or evasive speech.

In Teochew, the passive must always be accompanied by an agent. Where none is forthcoming, a dummy or generic agent can be used: *nang5* 儂 (“person”) in *khoi’4nang5* 乞儂 or *pung1nang5* 分儂.

This is unlike Mandarin, where the passive marker *bèi* 被 can be used without an agent:

> Nàge xiǎotōu **bèi** zhuō le.
>
> 那個 小偷 *被* 捉 了。
>
> That thief **PASS** catch PERF.
>
> That thief has been caught. \[By whom?\]

The analogous construction would be ungrammatical in Teochew:

> \* Heu2kai7 tsheu6tshak4kiar2 **khoi’4** lia’8 liou3.
>
> \* He2gai7 ce6cag4kian2 **koih4** liah8 liou3.
>
> \* 許個 鼠賊囝 **乞** 掠 了。
>
> \* That-CL thief **PASS** catch PERF.

Instead it requires a dummy agent:

> Heu2kai7 tsheu6tshak4kiar2 **khoi’4nang7** lia’8 liou3.
>
> He2gai7 ce6cag4gian2 **koih4nang7** liah8 liou3.
>
> 許個 鼠賊囝 *乞儂* 掠 了。
>
> That-CL thief **PASS-person** catch PERF.
>
> That thief has been caught by someone.


Uses of *khoi4* and *pung1*
---------------------------

Aside from marking the passive voice, the words *khoi’4* and *pung1* can be used as a straightforward verb for “to give” and a number of other functions.

### “To give”

> Ua2 **khoi’4** i1 tsek4-pung6 tseu1.
>
> Ua2 **koih4** i1 zêg4-bung6 ze1.
>
> 我 **乞** 伊 一本 書。
>
> I **give** he one-CL book.
>
> I give him a book.

### “To allow”

> Ua2 tsi6pai2 **khoi’4** leu6 zip8lai3, e7pai2 tsu7 mo2.
>
> Ua2 zi6bai2 **koih4** le6 rib8lai3, e7bai2 zu7 mo2.
>
> 我 只擺 **乞** 汝 進來, 下擺 就 孬。
>
> I this-time **allow** you enter, next-time then not-able.
>
> I’ll let you come in this time, but not the next time.

### “For” or “to”

> Ua2 khio’8-lai7 ***khoi’4*** leu6 thoih2.
>
> Ua2 kioh8-lai7 ***koih4*** le6 toin2.
>
> 我 挈來 **乞** 汝 睇。
>
> I take-here for you see.
>
> I’ll bring it here for you to see.

> \*\*\*

> Ua2 ***khoi’4*** leu6 tso7-kai7 khang1khue7
>
> Ua2 ***koih4*** le6 zo7-gai7 kang1kuê7
>
> 我 乞 汝 做個 工課
>
> I for you do-REL work
>
> The work that I did for you

In Hokkien, the word *kā* 共 is used for the senses of “for”, “to”, “with”, e.g. *guá kā lí kóng* “let me tell you...”.

### “Give” with *sang3*

Unlike *khoi’4* / *pung1*, the verb *sang3* 送 can be used in the sense of “to give” but not the other functions that *khoi’4* / *pung1* have.

> Ua2 ***sang2*** leu6 tsek4-pung6 tseu1.

> \* Ua2 tsi6pai2 ***sang2*** leu6 zip8lai3.

> \* Ua2 khio’8-lai7 ***sang2*** leu6 thoih2.
