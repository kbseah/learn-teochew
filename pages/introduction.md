Introduction
============
{: .no_toc}

The Teochew language (潮州話, Teochew[^1]: Tie7tsiu1-ue7, Mandarin: Cháozhōu huà) is a language that belongs to the Min 閩 group of Chinese (Sinitic) languages, more specifically to the Southern Min 閩南 subgroup. The Chinese language family is large and diverse, and although its members are commonly called “dialects”, they are often not mutually intelligible. Therefore it is appropriate to call them “languages” in their own right, or “topolects” (a term that was coined from Chinese 方言, T: huang1ngang5, M: fāngyán).

The other members of the Southern Min group are Hokkien (福建話, Hokkien: Hok-kiàn-ōe, M: Fújiàn huà), which is spoken in Fujian Province and Taiwan, and Hainanese (海南話, Hainanese: Hái-nâm-oe, M: Hǎinán huà), which is spoken on Hainan Island and the adjacent Leizhou Peninsula that is part of Guangdong Province. Each of these is composed of many more local dialects, which are mutually intelligible within but not (or only to a limited extent) across these languages.

The center of Teochew is within the eastern part of Guangdong Province, bordering Fujian. It is a minority language in Guangdong as a whole, where Cantonese (Yue) and Hakka have more speakers. The variety of Teochew spoken in Teochew City was previously considered the standard variety, as it was for a long time the administrative center of the region. However, the port city of Swatow (汕頭, T: Sua1thau5, M: Shàntóu) eventually eclipsed Teochew City in size and importance during the 19th century, and so the region and language is today also known as Teo-Swa (潮汕, M: Cháoshàn).

Characteristics of the Min languages
------------------------------------

Min languages constitute a distinct branch among Chinese languages. Technically:

> “It is generally recognized that the Min dialects, spoken by over 5 per cent of all Chinese, lie outside the mainstream of Chinese linguistic development. The defining characteristic of Min is the presence of lower register tones of both aspirated and unaspirated correspondences to the old voiced stops and affricates of Common Chinese.”
> (Norman 2003)

But this is quite technical. Easier to recognize are words that are found only in Min but not in other Chinese languages. Some of these are hypothesized to come from a non-Han substratum language.

In general, Min languages also have more words for negation than other Chinese languages. Their tonal system is more complex than northern languages like Mandarin, and they have a higher proportion of monosyllabic words.

Southern Min vs Northern Min

Unique features of Teochew language
-----------------------------------

Teochew can be understood to some extent by speakers of other Southern Min languages, especially Hokkien, to which it is the most closely related. However, there are several features that set it apart. In terms of pronunciation, Teochew retains the low-rising 陽上 tone (traditionally numbered 6, see [“Pronunciation and orthography”](pages/pronunciation.md)), which has been lost in most other Southern Min languages. Teochew lacks syllables that end in the -n and -t consonants, e.g. Hokkien *huat* 發 vs. Teochew *huak4*.

In terms of vocabulary, Teochew has several unique words, such as *tar3* 呾 “speak”, and the many words for “sleep”: *uk8* (Teochew), *ng’8* (Swatow, Thenghai), *ih6* (Jieyang), *ih’8* (Swatow, Chaoyang) 夗. The usage of many words is also different between Teochew and Hokkien: *thak4tseu1* 讀書 vs. *thak4tshe’4* 讀冊 “read/study” respectively.

Teochew culture

Emigration and the Teochew diaspora
-----------------------------------

Future of the Teochew language
------------------------------

Southern Min languages as a whole have about 50 million speakers worldwide, most of whom are first-language speakers (Ethnologue, 2019). It is hard to find an accurate estimate for the number of Teochew speakers within this group. In the 1950s, it was estimated at over 4 million in mainland China (Li 1959), and about 2 million in Southeast Asia (Phua, 1950). The number of Teochew speakers worldwide today is probably somewhere between 5 and 10 million speakers, which would be on the order of languages like Swedish and modern Greek.

With so many speakers, should there be any cause for concern? After all, in terms of language vitality, Southern Min languages have collectively been described as “vigorous”, corresponding to level 6a on the EGIDS (Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale) system (Ethnologue, 2019). This means that the language does not have a standardized form but is in “vigorous use” among all generations. That description would probably apply to Teochew within China. In diaspora communities, however, Teochew may be more accurately considered to be at risk (e.g. Veniranda 2015). Several factors contribute to this situation.

**Language and educational policy.** Most countries with Teochew diaspora communities have a non-Chinese national language that is the main medium of education and public life. In some cases, the use of Teochew was actively suppressed, e.g. during the period of discrimination against ethnic Chinese in Indonesia, and to a less drastic extent, the Speak Mandarin policy in Singapore which promoted Mandarin over so-called dialects. In Mainland China, Standard Mandarin, or Putonghua, is promoted as the national language over regional languages in public life.

**Language evolution and change**. Languages are dynamic and perpetually evolving. Where Teochew is a minority language, speakers will tend to assimilate foreign vocabulary and other linguistic elements in their speech. For example, this is seen in the numerous Hokkien, Malay, and English loanwords in Malaysian and Singaporean Teochew. The sounds of the language have also evolved, although this is hard to trace as the Teochew language has only been phonetically recorded since the late 19th century, but even in this period of time there have been phonological changes (Xu 2013).

**Standardization and orthography**. Pronunciation even within Teochew homeland has much regional variation, despite short geographical distances. Standard orthography is not widely adopted. Few texts are systematically written in romanized form. Use of Chinese characters not standardized, either.
