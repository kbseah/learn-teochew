Aspect and time expressions
===========================
{: .no_toc}

Chinese languages generally lack tense. Unlike Indo-European languages, which change the form of the verb depending on the tense (e.g. German present tense *Ich esse* “I eat”, preterite *Ich aß* “I ate”), Chinese languages indicate time in other ways: using time adverbs, through context, and using aspect markers.

For how to tell time on the clock and in the calendar, see [“Numbers and counting”](numbers.md).

Aspect
------

In English, what is usually taught in school as “tenses” are actually combinations of tense and aspect. Tense relates a point in time relative to the speaker, whereas aspect describes the duration of an action (denoted by a verb) in relation to that point in time. For example, “I bake a cake” is in the simple present tense, whereas “I have baked a cake” is still in the present tense, but adds the perfect aspect to the verb “to bake”. The action “baked” occurred before the present time when the sentence is spoken. In comparison, “I had baked a cake” is also in the perfect aspect, but in the past tense. To get a sense of the difference, compare the following statements:

> “Do you want some cake? I have baked the cake.”
>
> (The conversation is taking place in the present. The cake was baked in the past, but it is still relevant to the present situation.)

> “He wanted some cake. Fortunately, I had baked a cake.”
>
> (The speaker is relating events from the past. The cake was already baked at that point in time, and was relevant then, but is not relevant to the present.)

In Chinese, the verbs themselves do not change in form, like “bake/baked” in the example above. To indicate time and aspect, additional words are added before or after the verb. These can be adverbs, verb complements (see [“Verbal complements”](verbal_complements.md)), auxiliary verbs, and a special class of words called aspect markers.

### Comparison of aspect markers

In most Chinese languages, aspect markers come after the verb as a suffix, as in the Mandarin and Cantonese examples below. What distinguishes aspect markers from other parts of speech is that other words (e.g. negatives, potential markers) cannot be inserted between the verb and its aspect marker. In contrast, some of the most frequently used markers in Teochew (and other Southern Min languages) come before the verb as a prefix.

### Affirmative and habitual aspects

The affirmative aspect is used to affirm that an event or action has already been completed.

The habitual aspect is used to mean that a particular action or event is performed habitually.

These two aspects are indicated with *u6* 有, which is explained under [“Auxiliary verbs”](auxiliary_verbs.md).

### Perfective aspect

Actions that have already been completed.

The main aspect marker for the perfective is *liau2* 了, which is cognate with Mandarin *liǎo*. The pronunciation of *liau2* is variable (*lieu2*, *liou2*) and there are also contracted forms *lau7* and *lou7* 𡀔. Which form or pronunciation is preferred is regionally variable, but they have the same grammatical function.

<!-- Veniranda 2015 analyses three different PERF aspect markers: lou7 𡀔, tiau 掉, and tie’ 着, but I think it makes more sense to consider tiau and tie’ as RVCs rather than aspect markers -->

> A1-si7 u7 tham1bu1 a, Tham1bu1-tiau7tshai7tse1 tsa2 tsiu7 lai7 tshe1-***lou7***
>
> A7-si7 u7 tam1bhu1 a, Tam1bhu1-diao7cai7zê1 za2 ziu7 lai7 cê1-***lou7***
>
> 若是 有 貪污 a，貪污調查局 早 就來 查***𡀔***
>
> If have corruption , corruption-investigation-agency early then-come investigate-***PERF***
>
> If there was corruption, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Board would have come to investigate long ago.
>
> ([*Speech by Low Thia Khiang*](texts/low_thia_khiang.md))


### Change-of-state aspect

Closely related to the perfective aspect. This indicates that there is a new situation that has just happened, but which also affects the present context.

> Tsiak4 pung7 **lou7**!
>
> Ziag4 bung7 **lou7**!
>
> 嚼 飯 **𡀔**！
>
> Eat rice **CHS**!
>
> It’s time to eat!

This uses the same word as the perfective aspect marker. The same sentence can also be understood to mean “(I) have already eaten!”

### Experiential

Events that have been experienced by the subject in the past.

Most Chinese languages use a cognate of *kue3* 過 after the verb as the experiential aspect marker.

> Nǐ yǒu chī-**guò** kǔ mā?
>
> 你 有 吃 **過** 苦 嗎？
>
> You have eat-**EXP** bitterness PRT?
>
> Have you ever experienced suffering?

Teochew and other Min languages use the prefix *pak4* 識 instead.

> Leu2 **pak4** tsiak4khou2 bo5?
>
> Le2 **bag4** ziag4kou2 bho5?
>
> 汝 **識** 嚼苦 無？
>
> You EXP eat-bitterness NEG?

*pak4* is also a verb meaning “know”, “recognize”.

There is also a hybrid form with both the *pak4* prefix and *kue3* suffix, and *kue3* is sometimes also used by itself, perhaps influenced by Mandarin and standard written Chinese.

> Ua2 **pak4** tsiak4 **kue3** kai7 iam5, tsoi7 kue3 leu2 tsiak4 **kue3** kai7 pung7.
>
> Ua2 **bag4** ziag4 **guê3** gai7 iam5, zoi7 guê3 le2 ziag4 **guê3** gai7 bung7.
>
> 我 **識** 嚼 **過** 個 鹽， 濟 過 汝 嚼 **過** 個 飯。
>
> I **EXP** eat **EXP** REL salt, more COMP you eat **EXP** REL rice.
>
> I’ve eaten more salt than you’ve eaten rice.[^1]

Notice that the word *kue3* is also used as a comparative (see [“Comparisons, Quantities, Degrees”](comparisons.md)).

The word *pak4* is also a verb meaning “to know”, “recognize”.

> I1 tar2 i1 si7 leu2 teng7pai2 kai7 tang7hak8, leu2 u7 **pak4** i1 bo5?
>
> I1 dan2 i1 si7 le2 dêng7bai2 gai7 dang7hag8, le2 u7 **bag4** i1 bho5?
>
> 伊 呾 伊 是 汝 頂擺 個 同學， 汝 有 **識** 伊 無？
>
> He say he is you past REL classmate, you have **know** he NEG?
>
> He says he was your classmate; do you recognize him?

### Inceptive

Actions that have just begun, in the immediate past.

In Mandarin, this is expressed with the adverb *gānggāng* 剛剛. In Teochew, there are two adverbs that can be used to mark inceptive aspect: *tu1tu1* 堵堵 and *ngam1ngam1* 啱啱. The latter is a loanword from Cantonese.

> I1 **tu1tu1** tshuk8mung5, ua2 m7tsai1 i1 kui6tiam2 teung2lai7.
>
> I1 **du1du1** cug8mung5, ua2 m7zai1 i1 gui6diam2 deng2lai7.
>
> 伊 **堵堵** 出門， 我 唔知 伊 幾點 轉來。
>
> He **just** exit-door, I NEG-know he what-time return.
>
> He just left; I don’t know when he’ll be back.

Grammatically, these are adverbs rather than proper aspect markers. For example, they can be combined with other aspect markers, like the progressive marker *lo6* 囉:

> I1 **tu1tu1 lo6** tsiak4pung7, leu2 ai2 kie2 i1 kheu2 ti7ko7?
>
> I1 **du1du1 lo6** ziag4bung7, le2 ai2 giê2 i1 ke2 di7go7?
>
> 伊 **堵堵 囉** 嚼飯， 汝 愛 叫 伊 去 哋塊？
>
> He **just PRG**-eat, you want call him go where?
>
> He just sat down to have his meal; where are you calling him away to?

Like “just” in English, *tu1tu1* and *ngam1ngam1* can also be adverbs meaning “just right”, e.g. combined with *ho2* 好 “good”:

> Koi1neung7-ko1 hong1 puar2 tiam1tseng1 **ngam1ngam1ho2**.
>
> Goi1neng7-go1 hong1 buan2 diam1zêng1 **ngam1ngam1ho2**.
>
> Cake bake half hour **just-right**.
>
> Baking the cake for half an hour is just right.

In Southeast Asia, the Malay loanword *ba7lu1* (from *baru*/*baharu*, “new”) is also used to indicate inceptive aspect:

> I1 **ba7lu1** tshuk8mung5, ua2 m7tsai1 i1 kui6tiam2 teung2lai7.
>
> I1 **ba7lu1** cug8mung5, ua2 m7zai1 i1 gui6diam2 deng2lai7.
>
> 伊 **baru** 出門， 我 唔知 伊 幾點 轉來。
>
> He **just** exit-door, I NEG-know he what-time return.
>
> He just left; I don’t know when he’ll be back.

### Progressive

Actions that are ongoing.

Two of the markers for progressive aspect, *lo1* 囉 and *to6* 在, are neutral in meaning, compared to the third marker *pang2ko3* 放塊 which is used to emphasize that the person performing the action is doing so deliberately.

*to6* 在 is cognate to Mandarin *zài* and has similar usage:

Mandarin:

> Tā ***zài*** shuāyá.
>
> 他 ***在*** 刷牙。

Teochew:

> I1 ***to7*** tshiu2khi2.
>
> I1 ***do7*** ciu2ki2.
>
> 伊 ***在*** 漱齒。
>
> He/she ***PROG*** brush-teeth.
>
> He/she is brushing his/her teeth.

> \*\*\*

> U7 tsek4-tsua7, Pak8huang1 ka’8 Zik4tau5 ***lo1*** a7tar2 ti7tiang6 khiang3.
>
> U7 zêg4-zua7, Bag8huang1 gah8 Rig4thao5 ***lo1*** a7dan2 di7diang6 kiang3.
>
> 有 一帀， 北風 佮 日頭 ***囉*** 䛩呾 哋𫢗 強。
>
> Have one-time, north-wind with sun ***PROG*** argue who strong.
>
> Once upon a time, the North Wind and the Sun were arguing over which of them was stronger.
>
> ([*North Wind and the Sun*](texts/aesop.md))

In contrast, *pang7ko3* emphasizes that the action is deliberate.

> I1 bo7 to7 tso2 tsak8ngiep8, ***pang2ko3*** thoih2 tiang7si6.
>
> I1 bho7 do7 zo2 zag8ngiêp8, ***bang2go3*** toin2 diang7si6.
>
> 伊 無 在 做 作業， ***放塊*** 睇 電視。
>
> He/she NEG PROG do homework, ***PROG*** watch television.
>
> He/she is not doing his/her homework, but is watching television.
>
> (from Xu 2007, example 74)

### Continuous

States or situations that are stable and ongoing, without any comment on how they came about or when they might end.

Also known as the durative aspect, and not to be confused with the continuative aspect (see below). Related to the progressive, but the continuous aspect marker is a suffix, coming after the verb.

> I1 tso6-**to7ko3** thoi2 po2tsua2.
>
> I1 zo6-**do7go3** toi2 bo2zua2.
>
> 伊 做 在塊 睇 報紙。
>
> He sit-**CONT** read newspaper.
>
> He sits there reading the newspaper.[^2]

The various varieties of Teochew are particularly rich in markers for the progressive and continuative aspects. These markers originate from words related to location, such as *to6* 在 “at”, and *ko3* 塊 the general location suffix for demonstrative pronouns like *heu2ko3* 許塊 “there” and *ti7ko3* 哋塊 “where”.

### Delimitative

Actions that are of short duration.

The aspect marker *tsek4e7* 一下 is cognate with Mandarin *yíxià*, and literally means “one time” or “a moment”.

> Leu2 lai7 thoi2-**tsek4e7**: heu2kai7 si7-m7si7 Seung1-Ih2tseu1?!
>
> Le2 lai7 toi2-**zêg4ê7**: he2gai7 si7-m7si7 Seng1-In2ze1?!
>
> 汝 來 睇 **一下**： 許個 是唔是 孫燕姿？！
>
> You come look-**DEL**: that is-NEG-is Sun Yanzi?!
>
> Come have a look: isn’t that Stefanie Sun?!

### Tentative

Actions that test or try something.

The marker *thoi2* 睇 literally means “to see”, which is similar in spirit to the English expressions “try it and see” and “we shall see”.

> Leu2 tsiak4-**thoi2**, oi7 kha’4 tiam1 boi6?
>
> Le2 ziag4-**toi2**, oi7 kah4 diam1 bhoi6?
>
> 汝 嚼**睇**， 會 佮 甜 袂？
>
> You eat-**TEN**, can too sweet NEG?
>
> Could you have a taste of this; is it too sweet?

In Mandarin, the equivalent is *kàn* 看 “see”, but the verb must be reduplicated, which is not the case in Teochew.

> Nǐ chīchī-**kàn**, huì tài tián mā?
>
> 你 吃吃**看**， 會 太 甜 嗎？
>
> You eat-eat-**TEN**, can too sweet PRT?

### Inchoative

Actions or events that are just starting up. The marker *khi2lai5* 起來 is cognate to Mandarin *qǐlái* and is used in the same way.

> Kau2 kie2-***khi2lai7*** ua2 tsiu7 kiar1.
>
> Gao2 giê2-***ki2lai7*** ua2 ziu7 gian1.
>
> 狗 叫 ***起來*** 我 就 驚。
>
> Dog call-***INCH*** I then afraid.
>
> When dogs start to bark, I become afraid.

### Continuative

Actions that are continuing, expressed in English with the word “still”, e.g. “He is still making a fuss.”

Teocehw uses the aspect marker *lo’4kheu3* 落去. The Mandarin equivalent is *xiàqu* 下去

> Leu2 tsai6 thak8 ***lo’4kheu3***.
>
> Le2 zai6 tag8 ***loh4ke3***.
>
> 汝 再 讀 ***落去***。
>
> You again read-***CONT***.
>
> Keep on reading.
>
> (from Li 1959, pg. 255)
