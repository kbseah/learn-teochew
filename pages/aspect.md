Aspect and time expressions
===========================
{: .no_toc}

Chinese languages generally lack tense. Unlike Indo-European languages, which
change the form of the verb depending on the tense (e.g. German present tense
*Ich esse* “I eat”, preterite *Ich aß* “I ate”), Chinese languages indicate
time in other ways: using time adverbs, through context, and using aspect
markers.

For how to tell time on the clock and in the calendar, see [“Numbers and
counting”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/numbers.md %}).

Aspect
------

In English, what is usually taught in school as “tenses” are actually
combinations of tense and aspect. Tense relates a point in time relative to the
speaker, whereas aspect describes the duration of an action (denoted by a verb)
in relation to that point in time. For example, “I bake a cake” is in the
simple present tense, whereas “I have baked a cake” is still in the present
tense, but adds the perfect aspect to the verb “to bake”. The action “baked”
occurred before the present time when the sentence is spoken. In comparison, “I
had baked a cake” is also in the perfect aspect, but in the past tense. To get
a sense of the difference, compare the following statements:

> “Do you want some cake? I have baked the cake.”
>
> (The conversation is taking place in the present. The cake was baked in the
> past, but it is still relevant to the present situation.)

> “He wanted some cake. Fortunately, I had baked a cake.”
>
> (The speaker is relating events from the past. The cake was already baked at
> that point in time, and was relevant then, but is not relevant to the
> present.)

In Chinese, the verbs themselves do not change in form, like “bake/baked” in
the example above. To indicate time and aspect, additional words are added
before or after the verb. These can be adverbs, verb complements (see [“Verbal
complements”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/verbal_complements.md %})),
auxiliary verbs, and a special class of words called aspect markers.

### Comparison of aspect markers

In most Chinese languages, aspect markers come after the verb as a suffix, as
in the Mandarin and Cantonese examples below. What distinguishes aspect markers
from other parts of speech is that other words (e.g. negatives, potential
markers) cannot be inserted between the verb and its aspect marker. In
contrast, some of the most frequently used markers in Teochew (and other
Southern Min languages) come before the verb as a prefix.

### Affirmative and habitual aspects

The affirmative aspect is used to affirm that an event or action has already
been completed.

The habitual aspect is used to mean that a particular action or event is
performed habitually.

These two aspects are indicated with *u6* 有, which is explained under
[“Auxiliary verbs”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/auxiliary_verbs.md %}).

### Perfective aspect

Actions that have already been completed.

The main aspect marker for the perfective is *liao2* 了, which is cognate with
Mandarin *liǎo*. The pronunciation of *liao2* is variable (*liêu2*, *liou2*)
and there are also contracted forms *lao7* and *lou7* 𡀔. Which form or
pronunciation is preferred is regionally variable, but they have the same
grammatical function.

<!-- Veniranda 2015 analyses three different PERF aspect markers: lou7 𡀔, diao 掉, and diêh 着, but I think it makes more sense to consider diao and diêh as RVCs rather than aspect markers -->

> a³³si¹¹ u¹¹ tʰam³³bu³³ a / tʰam³³bu³³ tiau¹¹tsʰai¹¹tse³³ za⁵³ tsiu¹¹ lai¹¹ tsʰe³³ **lou¹¹**
>
> A1-si6(7) u6(7) tam1bhu1 a, Tam1bhu1-diao7cai5(7)zê1 za2 ziu6(7)lai5(7) cê1-**lou7**
>
> 若是 有 貪污 a，貪污調查局 早 就來 查 *𡀔*
>
> If have corruption , corruption-investigation-agency early then-come investigate-**PERF**
>
> If there was corruption, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Board would have come to investigate long ago.
>
> ([*Speech by Low Thia Khiang*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/texts/low_thia_khiang.md %}))


### Change-of-state aspect

Closely related to the perfective aspect. This indicates that there is a new
situation that has just happened, but which also affects the present context.

> tsiaʔ² puŋ¹¹ **lou¹¹**
>
> Ziah8(4) bung7 **lou7**!
>
> 食 飯 *𡀔*！
>
> Eat rice **CHS**!
>
> It’s time to eat!

This uses the same word as the perfective aspect marker. The same sentence can
also be understood to mean “(I) have already eaten!”

### Experiential

Events that have been experienced by the subject in the past.

Most Chinese languages use a cognate of *guê3* 過 after the verb as the
experiential aspect marker.

> Nǐ yǒu chī-**guò** kǔ mā?
>
> 你 有 吃 *過* 苦 嗎？
>
> You have eat-**EXP** bitterness PRT?
>
> Have you ever experienced suffering?

Teochew and other Min languages use the prefix *bag4* 識 instead.

> lɯ⁵² **pak⁵** tsiaʔ²kou⁵² bo⁵⁵
>
> Le2 **bag4(8)** ziah8(4)kou2 bho5?
>
> 汝 *識* 食苦 無？
>
> You EXP eat-bitterness NEG?

*bag4* is also a verb meaning “know”, “recognize”.

There is also a hybrid form with both the *bag4* prefix and *guê3* suffix, and
*guê3* is sometimes also used by itself, perhaps influenced by Mandarin and
standard written Chinese.

> ua⁵² **pak⁵** tsiaʔ² **kue²¹³** kai¹¹ iam⁵⁵ / tsoi¹¹ kue²¹³ lɯ⁵² tsiaʔ² **kue²¹³** kai¹¹ puŋ¹¹
>
> Ua2 **bag4(8)** ziah8(4) **guê3** gai5(7) iam5, zoi7 guê3(2) le2 ziah8(4) **guê3** gai5(7) bung7.
>
> 我 *識* 食 *過* 個 鹽， 濟 過 汝 食 *過* 個 飯。
>
> I **EXP** eat **EXP** REL salt, more COMP you eat **EXP** REL rice.
>
> I’ve eaten more salt than you’ve eaten rice.[^1]

Notice that the word *guê3* is also used as a comparative (see [“Comparisons,
Quantities, Degrees”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/comparisons.md %})).

The word *bag4* is also a verb meaning “to know”, “recognize”.

> i³³ tã⁵² i³³ si¹¹ lɯ⁵² teŋ²⁵pai⁵² kai¹¹ tʰaŋ¹¹hak⁵ / lɯ⁵² u¹¹ **pak⁵** i³³ bo⁵⁵
>
> I1 dan3(2) i1 si6(7) le2 dêng2(6)bai2 gai7 dang5(7)hag8, le2 u6(7) **bag4(8)** i1 bho5?
>
> 伊 呾 伊 是 汝 頂擺 個 同學， 汝 有 *識* 伊 無？
>
> He say he is you past REL classmate, you have **know** he NEG?
>
> He says he was your classmate; do you recognize him?

### Inceptive

Actions that have just begun, in the immediate past.

In Mandarin, this is expressed with the adverb *gānggāng* 剛剛. In Teochew,
there are two adverbs that can be used to mark inceptive aspect: *du1du1* 堵堵
and *ngam1ngam1* 啱啱. The latter is a loanword from Cantonese.

> i³³ **tu³³tu³³** tsʰuk⁵muŋ⁵⁵ / ua⁵² m¹¹tsai³³ i³³ kui³⁵tiam⁵² tɯŋ⁵²lai¹¹
>
> I1 **du1du1** cug4(8)mung5, ua2 m7zai1 i1 gui2(6)diam2 deng2lai7.
>
> 伊 *堵堵* 出門， 我 唔知 伊 幾點 轉來。
>
> He **just** exit-door, I NEG-know he what-time return.
>
> He just left; I don’t know when he’ll be back.

Grammatically, these are adverbs rather than proper aspect markers. For
example, they can be combined with other aspect markers, like the progressive
marker *lo6* 囉:

> i³³ **tu³³tu³³ lo²⁵** tsiaʔ²puŋ¹¹ / lɯ⁵² ai⁵² kie⁵² i³³ kɯ⁵² ti¹¹ko¹¹
>
> I1 **du1du1 lo6** ziah8(4)bung7, le2 ai3(2) giê3(2) i1 ke3(2) di7go7?
>
> 伊 *堵堵 囉* 食飯， 汝 愛 叫 伊 去 哋塊？
>
> He **just PRG**-eat, you want call him go where?
>
> He just sat down to have his meal; where are you calling him away to?

Like “just” in English, *tu1tu1* and *ngam1ngam1* can also be adverbs meaning
“just right”, e.g. combined with *ho2* 好 “good”:

> koi³³nɯŋ¹¹ko³³ hoŋ³³ pũã⁵³ tiam⁵³tseŋ³³ **ŋam³³ŋam³³ho⁵³**
>
> Goi1neng6(7)-go1 hong1 buan3(2) diam2(6)zêng1 **ngam1ngam1ho2**.
>
> 雞卵糕 烘 半 點鐘 *啱啱好*。
>
> Cake bake half hour **just-right**.
>
> Baking the cake for half an hour is just right.

In Southeast Asia, the Malay loanword *bha7lu1* (from *baru*/*baharu*, “new”)
is also used to indicate inceptive aspect:

> i³³ **ba¹¹lu³³** tsʰuk⁵muŋ⁵⁵ / ua⁵² m¹¹tsai³³ i³³ kui²⁵tiam⁵² tɯŋ⁵³lai¹¹
>
> I1 **bha7lu1** cug4(8)mung5, ua2 m7zai1 i1 gui2(6)diam2 deng2lai7.
>
> 伊 **baru** 出門， 我 唔知 伊 幾點 轉來。
>
> He **just** exit-door, I NEG-know he what-time return.
>
> He just left; I don’t know when he’ll be back.

### Progressive

Actions that are ongoing.

Two of the markers for progressive aspect, *lo1* 囉 and *do6* 在, are neutral
in meaning, compared to the third marker *bang2go3* 放塊 which is used to
emphasize that the person performing the action is doing so deliberately.

*do6* 在 is cognate to Mandarin *zài* and has similar usage:

Mandarin:

> Tā **zài** shuāyá.
>
> 他 *在* 刷牙。

Teochew:

> i³³ **to¹¹** tsʰiu⁵²kʰi⁵²
>
> I1 **do6(7)** ciu3(2)ki2.
>
> 伊 *在* 漱齒。
>
> He/she **PROG** brush-teeth.
>
> He/she is brushing his/her teeth.

> \*\*\*

> u¹¹ tsek²tsua¹¹ / pak⁵huaŋ³³ kaʔ⁵ zik⁵tʰau⁵⁵ **lo³³** a¹¹tã⁵³ ti¹¹tiaŋ¹¹ kʰiaŋ²¹³
>
> U6(7) zêg8(4)-zua7, Bag4(8)huang1 gah4(8) Rig8(4)tao5 **lo1** a7dan3(2) di7diang5(7) kiang3.
>
> 有 一帀， 北風 佮 日頭 *囉* 䛩呾 哋𫢗 強。
>
> Have one-time, north-wind with sun **PROG** argue who strong.
>
> Once upon a time, the North Wind and the Sun were arguing over which of them was stronger.
>
> ([*North Wind and the Sun*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/texts/aesop.md %}))

In contrast, *bang3(2)go3* emphasizes that the action is deliberate.

> i³³ bo¹¹ to¹¹ tso⁵² tsak⁵ŋiep⁵ / **paŋ⁵³ko²¹³** tʰõĩ⁵³ tiaŋ¹¹si²⁵
>
> I1 bho5(7) do6(7) zo3(2) zag4(8)ngiêp8, **bang3(2)go3** toin2 diang6(7)si6.
>
> 伊 無 在 做 作業， *放塊* 睇 電視。
>
> He/she NEG PROG do homework, **PROG** watch television.
>
> He/she is not doing his/her homework, but is watching television.
>
> (from Xu 2007, example 74)

### Continuous

States or situations that are stable and ongoing, without any comment on how
they came about or when they might end.

Also known as the durative aspect, and not to be confused with the continuative
aspect (see below). Related to the progressive, but the continuous aspect
marker is a suffix, coming after the verb.

> i³³ tso²⁵ **to¹¹ko²¹³** tʰoi⁵² po⁵²tsua⁵²
>
> I1 zo6-**do6(7)go3** toi2 bo3(2)zua2.
>
> 伊 坐 *在塊* 睇 報紙。
>
> He sit-**CONT** read newspaper.
>
> He sits there reading the newspaper.[^2]

The various varieties of Teochew are particularly rich in markers for the
progressive and continuative aspects. These markers originate from words
related to location, such as *do6* 在 “at”, and *go3* 塊 the general location
suffix for demonstrative pronouns like *he2(6)go3* 許塊 “there” and *di7go3*
哋塊 “where”.

### Delimitative

Actions that are of short duration.

The aspect marker *zêg8(4)ê7* 一下 is cognate with Mandarin *yíxià*, and
literally means “one time” or “a moment”.

> lɯ⁵² lai¹¹ tʰoi⁵² **tsek²e¹¹** / hɯ⁵²kai¹¹ si¹¹m¹¹si¹¹ sɯŋ³³ ieŋ⁵²tse³³
>
> Le2 lai5(7) toi2-**zêg8(4)ê7**: he2(6)gai5(7) si6(7)-m7si6(7) Seng1-Ieng3(2)ze1?!
>
> 汝 來 睇 *一下*： 許個 是唔是 孫燕姿？！
>
> You come look-**DEL**: that is-NEG-is Sun Yanzi?!
>
> Come have a look: isn’t that Stefanie Sun?!

### Tentative

Actions that test or try something.

The marker *toi2* 睇 literally means “to see”, which is similar in spirit to
the English expressions “try it and see” and “we shall see”.

> lɯ⁵² tsiaʔ² **tʰoi⁵²** / oi¹¹ kʰaʔ² tiam³³ boi²⁵
>
> Le2 ziah8(4)-**toi2**, oi6(7) kah8(4) diam1 bhoi6?
>
> 汝 食 *睇*， 會 佮 甜 袂？
>
> You eat-**TEN**, can too sweet NEG?
>
> Could you have a taste of this; is it too sweet?

In Mandarin, the equivalent is *kàn* 看 “see”, but the verb must be
reduplicated, which is not the case in Teochew.

> Nǐ chīchī-**kàn**, huì tài tián mā?
>
> 你 吃吃 *看*， 會 太 甜 嗎？
>
> You eat-eat-**TEN**, can too sweet PRT?

### Inchoative

Actions or events that are just starting up. The marker *ki3(2)lai5* 起來 is
cognate to Mandarin *qǐlái* and is used in the same way.

> kau⁵² kie⁵² **kʰi⁵²lai¹¹** ua⁵² tsiu¹¹ kĩã³³
>
> Gao2 giê3(2)-**ki3(2)lai5(7)** ua2 ziu7 gian1.
>
> 狗 叫 *起來* 我 就 驚。
>
> Dog call-**INCH** I then afraid.
>
> When dogs start to bark, I become afraid.

### Continuative

Actions that are continuing, expressed in English with the word “still”, e.g.
“He is still making a fuss.”

Teochew uses the aspect marker *loh8(4)ke3* 落去. The Mandarin equivalent is
*xiàqu* 下去

> lɯ⁵² tsai²⁵ tʰak⁵ **loʔ²kʰɯ²¹³**
>
> Le2 zai3(6) tag8 **loh8(4)ke3**.
>
> 汝 再 讀 *落去*。
>
> You again read-**CONT**.
>
> Keep on reading.
>
> (from Li 1959, pg. 255)
