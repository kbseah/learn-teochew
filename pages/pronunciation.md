Pronunciation and orthography
=============================
{: .no_toc}

This section describes the sounds of the Teochew language (pronunciation) and
how they can be written down (orthography). Heritage speakers will be familiar
with pronunciation, but this is usually at an instinctive level, without them
necessarily being aware of all the distinct sounds that they can distinguish
and speak. This is especially the case for languages that have not
traditionally been written down, like Teochew.

For new learners, the tones and certain vowel sounds, especially /ɯ/ and
nasalized vowels, are probably the most difficult to master. However, even
native speakers may find it hard to consciously describe and write down the
tones that they use, because it is learned instinctively. Being able to notate
the sounds of one’s language is a key aspect of metalinguistic awareness.

In this guide, several comparisons are made to Mandarin, which is the variety
of Chinese most commonly used for formal education, because it is assumed that
readers will already have some knowledge of its phonetic system from learning
Hanyu Pinyin.

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is used in this chapter to notate
sounds. IPA symbols are distinguished from surrounding text by slashes, e.g.
/pʰaʔ/. Other notation schemes will be surrounded by brackets, e.g. \[pha’\].
The rest of the study guide uses two different romanization systems,
the IPA, and Guangdong Peng’im, which uses only characters that are found
on standard keyboards. Pronunciations in the tables below are transcribed in
both IPA and Peng’im, as well as other systems developed by missionaries in the
19th century and which may be encountered in older texts. These are explained
more fully under “Orthography” below.

Consonants
----------

Syllables in Teochew may begin or end with a consonant, or have both, or have
no consonants.

| IPA            | Peng'im | Duffus    | Fielde |
|----------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| p              | b       | p         | p      |
| pʰ             | p       | ph        | ph     |
| b              | bh      | b         | b      |
| t              | d       | t         | t      |
| tʰ             | t       | th        | th     |
| ts             | z       | ts, ch    | c      |
| tsʰ            | c       | tsh, chh  | ch     |
| k              | g       | k         | k      |
| kʰ             | k       | kh        | kh     |
| g              | gh      | g         | g      |
| ʔ (final only) | -h      | -h        | -h     |
| m              | m       | m         | m      |
| n              | n       | n         | n      |
| ŋ              | ng      | ng        | ng     |
| s              | s       | s         | s      |
| h              | h       | h         | h      |
| z or dz        | r       | j, z      | j      |
| l              | l       | l         | l      |

### Aspirated and voiced consonants

The aspirated consonants /pʰ/, /tʰ/, /tsʰ/, /kʰ/ are similar to those in
Mandarin, and involve a slight forcing of air as the consonant is pronounced.
Their equivalents in Hanyu Pinyin are \[p\], \[t\], \[c\]/\[q\], and \[k\]
respectively. In the Wade-Giles system for Mandarin, aspirated consonants are
marked with an apostrophe.

Voiced consonants /b/, /g/, /dz/ are pronounced like /p/, /k/, and /ts/
respectively but with the vocal cords vibrating. These sounds are not found in
Mandarin.

The following pair of common words can be used to practice the
aspirated/unaspirated (/tʰ/ vs. /t/) and voiced/unvoiced (/g/ vs. /k/)
consonants:

> /tʰau˩ ke˧/ • 頭家 • “towkay, boss”
>
> /tau˩ ge˥/ • 豆芽 • “beansprout”

The following sentences will help in practising them:

> /tau˩ ge˩ tʰau˩ ke˧ kai˩ tau˩ ke˥˧/
>
> 豆芽 頭家 個 豆 假
>
> “the beansprout boss’s beans are fake”
>
> \*\*\*
>
> /tau˩ ge˩ tʰau˩ ke˧ kai˩ tʰau˥ bo˩ ge˧˥/
>
> 豆芽 頭家 個 頭 無 牙
>
> “the beansprout boss has no teeth in his head”

The “tʰ-” in /tʰau˩ ke˧/ is aspirated, while the “t-” in /tau˩ ge˥/ is
unaspirated. The “k-” in /tʰau˩ ke˧/ is unaspirated and unvoiced, while the
“g-” in /tau˩ ge˥/ is unaspirated and voiced.

### Initial and final consonants

/ŋ/ can come in the beginning of a syllable, unlike in Mandarin where it is
only found at the end. Indeed /ŋ/ and /m/ by themselves are valid syllables in
Teochew, e.g. /ŋ/ 黃 “yellow” (also a surname) and /m/ 唔 “not”.

The consonants /ŋ/, /m/, /p/, /k/, and /ʔ/ may come at the end of a syllable.
Of these, only the final /ŋ/ is also found in Mandarin. Mandarin has syllables
ending in /n/, which are not found in Teochew. Hokkien has final /t/, which is
not found in Teochew. /p/, /t/, /k/, and /ʔ/ are known as stops, because the
flow of air is suddenly interrupted. The glottal stop /ʔ/ is only found at the
end of syllables, whereas the other three may begin a syllable. Final stops are
short and not always pronounced clearly in everyday speech so they may be hard
to distinguish from each other, especially the /k/ /ʔ/ pair.

Vowels
------

The basic vowels in Teochew are as follows:

| IPA    | Peng’im | Duffus    | Fielde |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| a      | a       | a         | a      |
| e      | ê       | e         | e      |
| o      | o       | o         | o̤      |
| i      | i       | i         | i      |
| ɯ or ɤ | e       | ṳ         | ṳ      |
| u      | u       | u         | u      |

These basic vowels can also be combined into diphthongs or triphthongs, e.g.
/ia/, /iou/, /ue/.

In the system of Fielde (1883), the diphthongs /ou/ and /ua/ are represented by
[o] and [w] respectively.

### Nasalized vowels and di/triphthongs

Vowels can also be nasalized, where, as the name suggests, air is expelled from
the nose as well as the mouth when speaking. In rapid speech, it can be hard to
distinguish nasal from non-nasal vowels. The simple nasal vowels /ã/, /ẽ/ are
pronounced like in French:

> French *an* /ã/ “year”; Teochew /tã/ 呾 “speak”

> French *fin* /fẽ/ “end”; Teochew /sẽ/ 生 “birth”

However, Teochew has more nasalized vowels than French. Particularly
challenging is the nasalized triphthong

> /gũãĩ/ 果 “fruit”

### The vowel /ɯ/ or /ɤ/

The /ɯ/ or /ɤ/ vowel is similar to the Hanyu Pinyin vowel ‘i’ in Mandarin
\[zì\] 字 or \[sì\] 四, but **not** like the ‘i’ in \[jì\] 記 or \[xì\] 戲.
Hanyu Pinyin uses the same letter ‘i’ to represent both these vowel sounds, but
uses different letters to represent the same consonant in order to imply that
the vowel following it should be pronounced differently. If written in IPA,
they would be /tsɯ˥˧/ 字 vs. /tsi˥˧/ 記 and /sɯ˥˧/ 四 vs. /si˥˧/ 戲.

Finals
------

The following is a list of the possible combinations of vowels and consonants
into finals, i.e. syllables without the initial consonant. Syllables can also
start without a consonant, e.g. /ue/ 話 “speech”.

| IPA      | Peng’im    | Duffus     | Fielde     |

Tones
-----

Modern Chinese languages are tonal, but the number of tones is variable.
Teochew has eight tones, vs. four in Mandarin or seven in Cantonese. In
traditional Chinese scholarship, tones were classified into four kinds,
corresponding to the four tone classes in Middle Chinese: level 平, rising 上,
departing 去, and entering 入. The entering “tones” are not actually distinct
tones in terms of musical pitch, but represent syllables that end in a stop
consonant, i.e. /p/, /t/, /k/, /ʔ/. In Teochew, the four tone classes are
divided into two series, high 陰 and low 陽, although they do not necessarily
correspond to pitch differences.

### Notation of the tones

In IPA, tones are represented using a scale of five pitches that represent the
pitch contour of the sound, much as one would write music down with a scale of
musical notes. The lowest pitch is 1, the highest pitch is 5. For example, a
tone that falls in pitch, like the fourth tone of Mandarin, would be
represented by the number sequence 53, or with the symbol ˥˧. In Guangdong
Peng’im, the tones are simply numbered from 1 to 8 in the traditional order.
Peh-oi-ji was developed for Hokkien, which has one fewer tone than Teochew. In
Flattened IPA, the tone marks were chosen to mimic the contour of the pitch,
much like Hanyu Pinyin, which I felt to be more intuitive. Therefore most of
the tone marks are different or reversed compared to Peh-oi-ji.

| Name | IPA     | Peng’im | Duffus | Fielde |
|------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| 陰平 | 33 or ˧ | 1       | a      | a      |
| 陰上 | 53 ˥˧   | 2       | á      | á      |
| 陰去 | 213 ˨˩˧ | 3       | à      | à      |
| 陰入 | 2 ˨.    | 4       | ak     | ak     |
| 陽平 | 55 ˥    | 5       | â      | â      |
| 陽上 | 35 ˧˥   | 6       | ã      | ã      |
| 陽去 | 11 ˩    | 7       | ā      | ā      |
| 陽入 | 5 ˥.    | 8       | ȧk     | âk     |

### Tone sandhi

Another challenge for learners is that the tones can change depending on their
context, a phenomenon known as tone sandhi. In Mandarin, this is fairly simple:
the third tone changes to the second when it comes before another syllable in
the third tone. In Teochew, the situation is more complicated, because there
are more tones, and all except two of them undergo changes. Sandhi always
affects the preceding syllable in a series of syllables.

| Original tone | After tone sandhi |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 1             | 1                 |
| 2             | 6                 |
| 3             | 2 or 5            |
| 4             | 8                 |
| 5             | 7                 |
| 6             | 7                 |
| 7             | 7                 |
| 8             | 4                 |

A few rules may help in remembering how some of the tones should change:

 * Medium-level (1) and low-level (7) do not change
 * The entering tones (4 and 8) interchange
 * The low 陽 tones (5, 6, 7, 8) all become low (7, or 4 in the case of 8)

However, deciding what constitutes a series is not easy. Syllables in a
polysyllabic word will certainly undergo sandhi. Sandhi stops at phrase and
sentence boundaries. Sandhi can also be modified when speaking for emphasis, or
to convey different shades of meaning (e.g. see Li, 1959, pg. 16). It is
probably easiest to be aware of the basic sandhi changes and learn the patterns
by listening to native speakers.

In this study guide, the example phrases and sentences will be notated with
both the original (citation) tones and the changed (sandhi) tones in brackets,
to reflect how the phrases or sentences should sound when spoken out loud.
However the [Wiktionary index]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/teochew_wiktionary_index/teochew_wiktionary_index.md %})
lists only the citation tones, including in compound words, which is the
standard practice for dictionaries.

Orthography
-----------

Different schemes have been developed for writing Teochew phonetically. The
rest of the study guide uses both IPA and Guangdong Peng’im (the standard
promulgated by the Guangdong regional government) side-by-side to write
Teochew. For other Chinese languages occasionally quoted in examples, the
following systems are used: Mandarin – Hanyu Pinyin, Hokkien – Peh-oi-ji,
Cantonese – modified Yale.

The different orthographies are compared in detail in the tables above. Here
are some notes on their key features and points where they differ from one
another.

### Guangdong Peng’im

 * Published by the Guangdong Provincial Education Department in 1960.
 * Used in most works on Teochew published in mainland China.
 * Distinguishes between aspirated and unaspirated consonants with e.g.
   \[p\]/\[b\], \[t\]/\[d\], \[k\]/\[g\], similarly to Hanyu Pinyin. In IPA,
   these symbols would represent unvoiced/voiced pairs.
 * Glottal stop final is represented by “-h”, like Peh-oi-ji.
 * /z/ or /dz/ is represented by \[r\]
 * /ɯ/ or /ʏ/ is represented by \[e\]; /e/ by \[ê\].
 * Nasalized vowels are marked by adding \[-n\], e.g. \[ain\] (IPA: /ãĩ/).
 * Tones represented by numbers 1 through 8.

### Duffus (1883) and Fielde (1883)

 * Developed by Christian missionaries for translating Bibles and Christian
   texts into Teochew/Swatow. Both systems are similar to each other, and
   appear to be based on the Peh-oi-ji system, also developed by missionaries,
   for Hokkien. The system used by Lim (1886) is similar to that of Duffus.
 * Used in missionary works and Bible translations published in the 19th
   century.
 * Aspirated consonants marked by adding \[-h\], e.g. \[ph\] (IPA: /pʰ/). 
 * Duffus (1883) preserves the distinction between /ts/ (written as \[ts\]) and
   /tʃ/ (written as \[c\]), and their aspirated forms /tsʰ/ (\[ch\]) and /tʃʰ/
   (\[chh\]). These were later merged into /ts/ and /tsʰ/ by Teochew speakers
   in the late 19th century (Xu, 2013).
 * /z/ is represented by \[j\] or \[z\]
 * /ɯ/ or /ʏ/ are represented by \[ṳ\]
 * Fielde (1883) uses \[w\] to represent /ua/ in some syllables, \[o\] for /ou/,
   and \[o̤\] for /o/.
 * Nasalized vowels marked with superscript n, e.g. \[aiⁿ\] (IPA: /ãĩ/)
 * Preserves final /-t/ and /-n/ that were lost in 20th century Teochew.
   Guangdong Peng'im cannot write /-n/ finals because it already uses \[-n\] to
   represent nasalization.
 * Tones represented by accent marks.
 * Syllables that join words or phrases that result in tone change (sandhi)
   are joined by hyphens.
 * Verb complements and particles that do not result in tone change of the
   preceding syllable are joined by double hyphens (in Duffus’s system)

### Other systems

 * [Gaginang Peng’im](https://web.archive.org/web/20120206231733/http://www.gaginang.org/teochew/pengim-guide.html)
   is used by the Gaginang online portal and associated online communities,
   mostly by diaspora Teochews. It is similar to Guangdong Peng’im, e.g. using
   \[ao\] for /au/, \[-n\] for nasalization, \[p\]/\[b\]/\[bh\] for
   aspirated/unaspirated/voiced. Differences from Guangdong Peng’im:
     * Initials: \[j\] for /ts/, \[y\] for /dz/, \[ch\] for /tsʰ/
     * Vowels: \[eu\] for /ɯ/
     * Stops: \[-p\] for /p/, \[-k\] for /-k/, and \[-t\] for /-t/
     * Tone marks: \[a\], \[à\], \[ă\], \[ak\], \[ā\], \[á\], \[ạ\], \[āk\]
 * Teochew Romanization System of the [Teochew Tsiann-im Tsiann-zi Tshok-tsin-hue](http://teochew.pw) 
   (Teochew Association for Orthoepy and Orthography) is used in several
   online communities of Teochews in mainland China. It is similar to the
   missionary systems and Peh-oi-ji, e.g. in the tone marks, use of hyphens,
   and preservation of final \[-t\]. Differences from the Duffus system:
     * Initials: \[z\] for /dz/
     * Vowels: \[ur\] for /ɯ/
     * Nasalization shown by suffix \[-nn\]
 * The textbook *Spoken Swatow* (Koons and Koons, [1967] 2016) uses a phonetic
    system based on *Manual of Articulatory Phonetics* by W. Smalley (1963). 

### Word spacing and punctuation

Texts written in Chinese characters do not usually have word spacing, and
traditionally also lacked punctuation.

ImagineifEnglishwerealsowrittenwithoutwordspacingorpuncutationreadingwouldbeslowerandmoredifficult.

In this study guide, word spacing will be used in both the romanized and
Chinese character texts. The rules for word spacing will broadly follow [the
standard for Hanyu Pinyin](http://www.pinyin.info/readings/zyg/rules.html). For
romanized texts, the initial letters at the start of a sentence, and the first
letters of proper nouns, will be capitalized. Punctuation marks follow English
convention.

Chinese characters
------------------

One might ask: As a Chinese language, shouldn’t Teochew be written with Chinese
characters? Unfortunately, it is not the case that every word in Teochew can be
unambiguously mapped to a Chinese character used in Mandarin or literary
Chinese. Unlike Cantonese and Taiwanese Hokkien, no education authority has
published a standard Chinese character orthography for Teochew, and there is
not a strong written tradition of texts to build precedent.

Several very common words do not have Chinese characters, e.g. /mũã/ in /mũã
zik/ ~日 “tomorrow”. In Taiwanese, which is closely related to Teochew, it has
been estimated that about 15% of the words in a given text, including many
high-frequency words, cannot be represented by characters that are cognate with
words in Mandarin or Literary Chinese (Cheng 1978). Some authors may “borrow”
characters with similar sounds or meaning to represent them, e.g. 明日, but
these characters may already have a distinct original pronunciation, in this
case /meŋ/ 明. Different authors may use different characters for the same
word, or the same character for different words, e.g. /mẽ ni/ 明年 “next year”,
which is also written 夜年.

Chinese authors writing about Teochew have used variant characters to represent
some of these words without clear Mandarin or literary Chinese equivalents,
e.g. 𠁞 (Unicode U+2005E) for /boi/ “cannot”. Unfortunately many of these
characters are not found in most computer fonts. Some are not even found in
Unicode, e.g. 口+乜 /me/ (Li 1959, pg. 259). This makes typing them on most
systems quite laborious, especially for a word that is as common as /boi/.

Cognates may sometimes be written with different characters in different
languages. For example, most Teochew writers use 𠁞 for /boi/, but the Taiwan
education ministry recommends 袂 for its cognate in Hokkien, also pronounced
/boi/. The variant character 𣍐 (Unicode U+23350) is also used.

Many of the Chinese characters used to write certain Teochew words are probably
used for their phonetic value only, because they contain the “mouth” radical
口, e.g. /ti¹¹/ 哋 and /m³⁵/ 唔.

The final challenge with using Chinese characters is that Teochew, like other
Southern Min languages, makes extensive use of literary vs. colloquial
pronunciations (文白異讀, see below).

In this study guide, Chinese characters will be used as a help for readers who
already know Mandarin or another Chinese language and who may be interested in
recognizing cognates. However I can make no guarantees about the etymology and
do not adhere to or mean to propose any standard, although I try to follow the
usage of Li (1959), or of entries in Wiktionary. Traditional characters are
used here, because they are used in most of the reference works consulted.

### Literary vs. vernacular pronunciations

Chinese characters can have different pronunciations in Teochew. When reciting
from texts, and in vocabulary with a more formal register, the literary
pronunciation is used. For everyday speech, and for “earthier” language, the
vernacular pronunciation is used. Literary pronunciations tend to be closer to
Mandarin or “official language” (官話 M: guānhuà).

For example, the character 學 “learn” has two pronunciations:

> /hak⁵/ • hag8 • literary

> /oʔ⁵/ • oh8 • vernacular

Both forms are encountered in various compound words:

> /oʔ²tɯŋ⁵⁵/ • oh8(4)deng5 • 學堂 • “school” (traditional)

> /hak²hau³⁵/ • hag8(4)hao6 • 學校 • “school” (modern)

> /hak²seŋ³³/ • hag8(4)sêng1 • 學生 • “student” (*seng1* is also literary, cf. colloquial *ser1*)

> /tua¹¹oʔ⁵/ • dua7oh8 • 大學 • “university” (both characters with vernacular pronunciation)

> /tai¹¹hak⁵/ • dai7hag8 • 大學 • “university” (both characters with literary pronunciation)

In addition, a number of characters are pronounced differently when used as a
surname. See [“Terms of address”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/address.md %}).


Regional differences in pronunciation
-------------------------------------

The different counties within the Teochew region (see
[“Introduction”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/introduction.md %}) have their
own local dialects of the Teochew language, which have some differences in
pronunciation. For example:

 * /-ie/ (Teochew city) vs. /-io/ (Swatow), e.g. /tie⁵⁵/ vs. /tio⁵⁵/ 潮
 * /-oi/ (Teochew city) vs. /-ai/ (Gêg-ion), e.g. /sõĩ³³/ vs. /sãĩ³³/ 先
 * /-ieu/ (Teochew city) vs. /-iao/ (Swatow) vs. /-iou/ (Têng-hai), e.g. /lieu⁵³/, /liao⁵³/, /lieu⁵³/ 了

dialect pronunciations are also indicated in online dictionaries like
[Mogher.com](https://www.mogher.com) and
[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page).


Historical changes in pronunciation
-----------------------------------

Spoken Teochew was not written with phonetic spelling until the arrival of
Western missionaries in the 19th century. Their records of Teochew
pronunciation allow us to see how the pronunciation has changed over the past
two centuries. Changes include:

 * Merger of /-t/ stop at the end of syllables into /-k/
 * Merger of /-n/ ending to /-ng/
 * Distinction between the pairs of initials /ts/ and /tʃ/, and /tsʰ/ and /tʃʰ/
   has been lost

Some of the older forms may be retained in some regions or in diaspora
communities. Diaspora communities also experience other phonological changes in
their speech because of influences from other languages in the wider community.

The historical changes were briefly sketched by Bodman (1982), and more
carefully reconstructed by Xu (2013).
