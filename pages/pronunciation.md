Pronunciation and orthography
=============================
{: .no_toc}

This section describes the sounds of the Teochew language (pronunciation) and how they can be written down (orthography). Heritage speakers will be familiar with pronunciation, but this is usually at an instinctive level, without them necessarily being aware of all the distinct sounds that they can distinguish and speak. This is especially the case for languages that have not traditionally been written down, like Teochew.

For new learners, the tones and certain vowel sounds, especially /ɯ/ and nasalized vowels, are probably the most difficult to master. However, even native speakers may find it hard to consciously describe and write down the tones that they use, because it is learned instinctively. Being able to notate the sounds of one’s language is a key aspect of metalinguistic awareness.

In this guide, several comparisons are made to Mandarin, which is the variety of Chinese most commonly used for formal education, because it is assumed that readers will already have some knowledge of its phonetic system from learning Hanyu Pinyin.

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is used in this chapter to notate sounds. IPA symbols are distinguished from surrounding text by slashes, e.g. /pʰaʔ/. Other notation schemes will be surrounded by brackets, e.g. \[pha’\]. The rest of the study guide uses two different romanization systems, “flattened” IPA and Guangdong Peng’im, which use only characters that are found on standard keyboards. This is explained more fully under “Orthography” below.

Consonants
----------

Syllables in Teochew may begin or end with a consonant, or have both, or have no consonants.

| IPA            | Flattened IPA |  Guangdong Peng'im | Peh-oi-ji |
|----------------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| p              | p             | b        | p         |
| pʰ             | ph            | p        | ph        |
| b              | b             | bh       | b         |
| t              | t             | d        | t         |
| tʰ             | th            | t        | th        |
| ts             | ts            | z        | ch        |
| tsʰ            | tsh           | c        | chh       |
| k              | k             | g        | k         |
| kʰ             | kh            | k        | kh        |
| g              | g             | gh       | g         |
| ʔ (final only) | -’            | -h       | -h        |
| m              | m             | m        | m         |
| n              | n             | n        | n         |
| ŋ              | ng            | ng       | ng        |
| s              | s             | s        | s         |
| h              | h             | h        | h         |
| z or dz        | z             | r        | j         |
| l              | l             | l        | l         |

### Aspirated and voiced consonants

The aspirated consonants /pʰ/, /tʰ/, /tsʰ/, /kʰ/ are similar to those in Mandarin, and involve a slight forcing of air as the consonant is pronounced. Their equivalents in Hanyu Pinyin are \[p\], \[t\], \[c\]/\[q\], and \[k\] respectively. In the Wade-Giles system for Mandarin, aspirated consonants are marked with an apostrophe.

Voiced consonants /b/, /g/, /dz/ are pronounced like /p/, /k/, and /ts/ respectively but with the vocal cords vibrating. These sounds are not found in Mandarin.

The following pair of common words can be used to practice the aspirated/unaspirated (/tʰ/ vs. /t/) and voiced/unvoiced (/g/ vs. /k/) consonants:

> /tʰau˩ ke˧/ • 頭家 • “towkay, boss”
>
> /tau˩ ge˥/ • 豆芽 • “beansprout”

The following sentences will help in practising them:

> /tau˩ ge˩ tʰau˩ ke˧ kai˩ tau˩ ke˥˧/
>
> 豆芽 頭家 個 豆 假
>
> “the beansprout boss’s beans are fake”
>
> \*\*\*
>
> /tau˩ ge˩ tʰau˩ ke˧ kai˩ tʰau˥ bo˩ ge˧˥/
>
> 豆芽 頭家 個 頭 無 牙
>
> “the beansprout boss has no teeth in his head”

The “tʰ-” in /tʰau˩ ke˧/ is aspirated, while the “t-” in /tau˩ ge˥/ is unaspirated. The “k-” in /tʰau˩ ke˧/ is unaspirated and unvoiced, while the “g-” in /tau˩ ge˥/ is unaspirated and voiced.

### Initial and final consonants

/ŋ/ can come in the beginning of a syllable, unlike in Mandarin where it is only found at the end. Indeed /ŋ/ and /m/ by themselves are valid syllables in Teochew, e.g. /ŋ/ 黃 “yellow” (also a surname) and /m/ 唔 “not”.

The consonants /ŋ/, /m/, /p/, /k/, and /ʔ/ may come at the end of a syllable. Of these, only the final /ŋ/ is also found in Mandarin. Mandarin has syllables ending in /n/, which are not found in Teochew. Hokkien has final /t/, which is not found in Teochew. /p/, /t/, /k/, and /ʔ/ are known as stops, because the flow of air is suddenly interrupted. The glottal stop /ʔ/ is only found at the end of syllables, whereas the other three may begin a syllable. Final stops are short and not always pronounced clearly in everyday speech so they may be hard to distinguish from each other, especially the /k/ /ʔ/ pair.

Vowels
------

The basic vowels in Teochew are as follows:

| IPA    | Flattened IPA | Guangdong Peng’im | Peh-oi-ji |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| a      | a             | a                 | a         |
| e      | e             | ê                 | e         |
| o      | o             | o                 | o         |
| i      | i             | i                 | i         |
| ɯ or ɤ | eu            | e                 | eu        |
| u      | u             | u                 | u         |

These basic vowels can also be combined into diphthongs or triphthongs, e.g. /ia/, /iou/, /ue/.

### Nasalized vowels and di/triphthongs

Vowels can also be nasalized, where, as the name suggests, air is expelled from the nose as well as the mouth when speaking. In rapid speech, it can be hard to distinguish nasal from non-nasal vowels. The simple nasal vowels /ã/, /ẽ/ are pronounced like in French:

> French *an* /ã/ “year”; Teochew /tã/ 呾 “speak”

> French *fin* /fẽ/ “end”; Teochew /sẽ/ 生 “birth”

However, Teochew has more nasalized vowels than French. Particularly challenging is the nasalized triphthong

> /gũãĩ/ 果 “fruit”

### The vowel /ɯ/ or /ɤ/

The /ɯ/ or /ɤ/ vowel is similar to the Hanyu Pinyin vowel ‘i’ in Mandarin \[zì\] 字 or \[sì\] 四, but **not** like the ‘i’ in \[jì\] 記 or \[xì\] 戲. Hanyu Pinyin uses the same letter ‘i’ to represent both these vowel sounds, but uses different letters to represent the same consonant in order to imply that the vowel following it should be pronounced differently. If written in IPA, they would be /tsɯ˥˧/ 字 vs. /tsi˥˧/ 記 and /sɯ˥˧/ 四 vs. /si˥˧/ 戲.

Finals
------

The following is a list of the possible combinations of vowels and consonants into finals, i.e. syllables without the initial consonant. Syllables can also start without a consonant, e.g. /ue/ 話 “speech”.

Tones
-----

Modern Chinese languages are tonal, but the number of tones is variable. Teochew has eight tones, vs. four in Mandarin or seven in Cantonese. In traditional Chinese scholarship, tones were classified into four kinds, corresponding to the four tone classes in Middle Chinese: level 平, rising 上, departing 去, and entering 入. The entering “tones” are not actually distinct tones in terms of musical pitch, but represent syllables that end in a stop consonant, i.e. /p/, /t/, /k/, /ʔ/. In Teochew, the four tone classes are divided into two series, high 陰 and low 陽, although they do not necessarily correspond to pitch differences.

### Notation of the tones

In IPA, tones are represented using a scale of five pitches that represent the pitch contour of the sound, much as one would write music down with a scale of musical notes. The lowest pitch is 1, the highest pitch is 5. For example, a tone that falls in pitch, like the fourth tone of Mandarin, would be represented by the number sequence 53, or with the symbol ˥˧. In Guangdong Peng’im, the tones are simply numbered from 1 to 8 in the traditional order. Peh-oi-ji was developed for Hokkien, which has one fewer tone than Teochew. In Flattened IPA, the tone marks were chosen to mimic the contour of the pitch, much like Hanyu Pinyin, which I felt to be more intuitive. Therefore most of the tone marks are different or reversed compared to Peh-oi-ji.

| Name | IPA     | Flattened IPA | Guangdong Peng’im | Peh-oi-ji |
|------|---------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 陰平 | 33 or ˧ | a             | 1                 | a         |
| 陰上 | 53 ˥˧   | à             | 2                 | á         |
| 陰去 | 213 ˨˩˧ | ă             | 3                 | à         |
| 陰入 | 2 ˨.    | ak            | 4                 | ak        |
| 陽平 | 55 ˥    | ā             | 5                 | â         |
| 陽上 | 35 ˧˥   | á             | 6                 |           |
| 陽去 | 11 ˩    | ǎ             | 7                 | ā         |
| 陽入 | 5 ˥.    | āk            | 8                 | ȧk        |

### Tone sandhi

Another challenge for learners is that the tones can change depending on their context, a phenomenon known as tone sandhi. In Mandarin, this is fairly simple: the third tone changes to the second when it comes before another syllable in the third tone. In Teochew, the situation is more complicated, because there are more tones, and all except two of them undergo changes. Sandhi always affects the preceding syllable in a series of syllables.

| Original tone | After tone sandhi |
|-----|--------|
| 1   | 1      |
| 2   | 6      |
| 3   | 2 or 5 |
| 4   | 8      |
| 5   | 7      |
| 6   | 7      |
| 7   | 7      |
| 8   | 4      |

A few rules may help in remembering how some of the tones should change:

-   Medium-level (1) and low-level (7) do not change
-   The entering tones (4 and 8) interchange
-   The low 陽 tones (5, 6, 7, 8) all become low (7, or 4 in the case of 8)

However, deciding what constitutes a series is not easy. Syllables in a polysyllabic word will certainly undergo sandhi. Sandhi stops at phrase and sentence boundaries. Sandhi can also be modified when speaking for emphasis, or to convey different shades of meaning (e.g. see Li, 1959, pg. 16). It is probably easiest to be aware of the basic sandhi changes and learn the patterns by listening to native speakers.

In this study guide, the example phrases and sentences will be notated with the tones *after* sandhi, to reflect how the phrases or sentences should sound when spoken out loud, but the [Wiktionary index]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/teochew_wiktionary_index/teochew_wiktionary_index.md %}) uses the original (“citation”) tone, which is the standard practice for dictionaries.

Orthography

Different schemes have been developed for writing Teochew phonetically. The rest of the study guide uses both a “flattened” adaptation of IPA and Guangdong Peng’im (the standard promulgated by the Guangdong regional government) side-by-side to write Teochew. For other Chinese languages occasionally quoted in examples, the following systems are used: Mandarin – Hanyu Pinyin, Hokkien – Peh-oi-ji, Cantonese – modified Yale.

The different orthographies are compared in detail in the tables above. Here are some notes on their key features and points where they differ from one another.

### Guangdong Peng’im

-   Published by the Guangdong Provincial Education Department in 1960. Served as the basis for Gaginang Peng’im, used by the Gaginang online portal.
-   Distinguishes between aspirated and unaspirated consonants with e.g. “p/b”, “t/d”, “k/g”, similarly to Hanyu Pinyin. In IPA, these symbols would represent unvoiced/voiced pairs.
-   Glottal stop final is represented by “-h”, like Peh-oi-ji.
-   /z/ is represented by “r”
-   /ɯ/ is represented by “e”; /e/ by “ê”.
-   Nasalized vowels are marked by adding “-n”, e.g. “ain” (IPA: /ãĩ/).
-   Tones represented by numbers 1 through 8.

### Peh-oi-ji

-   Originally developed by Christian missionaries for transcribing Hokkien, but can be adapted for Teochew.
-   Aspirated consonants marked by adding “-h”, e.g. “ph” (IPA: /pʰ/). The exception is “ch” for /ts/. This results in “chh” for the aspirated /tsʰ/.
-   /z/ is represented by “j”
-   /ɯ/ is represented by “eu”
-   Nasalized vowels marked with superscript n, e.g. “ai<sup>n</sup>” (IPA: /ãĩ/)
-   Tones represented by accent marks.
-   Syllables separated by hyphens.

### Flattened IPA

-   Used in this guide, attempts to visually resemble IPA symbols (e.g. “th” for /tʰ/, “ng” for /ŋ/) while using only standard keyboard characters without superscripts (except for notating tones).
-   Glottal stop represented by “-’”
-   /ɯ/ represented by “eu”, like Peh-oi-ji
-   Nasalized vowels marked by adding “-r” or “-h”, e.g. “aih” (IPA: /ãĩ/), which looks more natural to English speakers than “-n” used by Guangdong Peng’im.
-   Spacing at word boundaries whenever possible; syllables hyphenated when there is possible ambiguity in parsing (e.g. kak-ui vs. ka-kui), or in certain prefixes (e.g. numbers) and set phrases.
-   Tones represented by accent marks, that roughly mirror pitch contours, unlike in Peh-oi-ji.

### Word spacing and punctuation

Texts written in Chinese characters do not usually have word spacing, and traditionally also lacked punctuation.

In this study guide, word spacing will be used in both the romanized and Chinese character texts. The rules for word spacing will broadly follow [the standard for Hanyu Pinyin](http://www.pinyin.info/readings/zyg/rules.html). For romanized texts, the initial letters at the start of a sentence, and the first letters of proper nouns, will be capitalized. Punctuation marks follow English convention.

Chinese characters
------------------

One might ask: As a Chinese language, shouldn’t Teochew be written with Chinese characters? Unfortunately, it is not the case that every word in Teochew can be unambiguously mapped to a Chinese character used in Mandarin or literary Chinese. Unlike Cantonese and Taiwanese Hokkien, no education authority has published a standard Chinese character orthography for Teochew, and there is not a strong written tradition of texts to build precedent.

Several very common words do not have Chinese characters, e.g. /mũã/ in /mũã zik/ ~日 “tomorrow”. In Taiwanese, which is closely related to Teochew, it has been estimated that about 15% of the words in a given text, including many high-frequency words, cannot be represented by characters that are cognate with words in Mandarin or Literary Chinese (Cheng 1978). Some authors may “borrow” characters with similar sounds or meaning to represent them, e.g. 明日, but these characters may already have a distinct original pronunciation, in this case /meŋ/ 明. Different authors may use different characters for the same word, or the same character for different words, e.g. /mẽ ni/ 明年 “next year”, which is also written 夜年.

Chinese authors writing about Teochew have used variant characters to represent some of these words without clear Mandarin or literary Chinese equivalents, e.g. 𠁞 (Unicode U+2005E) for /boi/ “cannot”. Unfortunately many of these characters are not found in most computer fonts. Some are not even found in Unicode, e.g. 口+乜 /me/ (Li 1959, pg. 259). This makes typing them on most systems quite laborious, especially for a word that is as common as /boi/.

Cognates may sometimes be written with different characters in different languages. For example, most Teochew writers use 𠁞 for /boi/, but the Taiwan education ministry recommends 袂 for its cognate in Hokkien, also pronounced /boi/. The variant character 𣍐 (Unicode U+23350) is also used.

Many of the Chinese characters used to write certain Teochew words are probably used for their phonetic value only, because they contain the “mouth” radical 口, e.g. ti7 哋 and m7 唔.

The final challenge with using Chinese characters is that Teochew, like other Southern Min languages, makes extensive use of literary vs. colloquial pronunciations (文白異讀, see below).

In this study guide, Chinese characters will be used as a help for readers who already know Mandarin or another Chinese language and who may be interested in recognizing cognates. However I can make no guarantees about the etymology and do not adhere to or mean to propose any standard, although I try to follow the usage of Li (1959), or of entries in Wiktionary. Traditional characters are used here, because they are used in most of the reference works consulted.

### Literary vs. vernacular pronunciations

Chinese characters can have different pronunciations in Teochew. When reciting from texts, and in vocabulary with a more formal register, the literary pronunciation is used. For everyday speech, and for “earthier” language, the vernacular pronunciation is used. Literary pronunciations tend to be closer to Mandarin or “official language” (官話 M: guānhuà).

For example, the character 學 “learn” has two pronunciations:

> hak8 • hag8 • literary

> o’8 • oh8 • vernacular

Both forms are encountered in various compound words:

> o’4teung5 • oh4deng5 • 學堂 • “school” (traditional)

> hak4hau6 • hag4hao6 • 學校 • “school” (modern)

> hak4seng1 • hag4sêng1 • 學生 • “student” (*seng1* is also literary, cf. colloquial *ser1*)

> tua7o’8 • dua7oh8 • 大學 • “university” (both characters with vernacular pronunciation)

> tai7hak8 • dai7hag8 • 大學 • “university” (both characters with literary pronunciation)

In addition, a number of characters are pronounced differently when used as a surname. See [“Terms of address”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/address.md %}).
