# Teochew Wiktionary Index

[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) includes Teochew pronunciations of
Chinese characters and words. Unfortunately these are indexed by characters,
making it difficult to look entries up by pronunciation. Teochew words written
with non-standard characters, or which do not have a character, are also hard to
find. The same is true for other online dictionaries of Teochew, such as
[mogher.com](https://www.mogher.com). [czyzd.com](http://www.czyzd.com) is an
exception which offers lookup in both characters and Guangdong Peng'im.

The following is a re-indexing of Chinese entries in English Wiktionary
(definitions are in English) by Teochew pronunciation, using Guangdong Peng'im.
Some words may have more than one pronunciation, because of the literary vs.
vernacular readings or because of regional variation, so these are indexed in
more than one place. The advantages of Wiktionary over other online dictionaries
is that it is continuously being updated by contributors, and often includes
pronunciations, synonyms, and usage in multiple Chinese languages. Click on the
