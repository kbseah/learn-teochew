Demonstrative pronouns are words like “this” and “that”, which point to specific things, persons, etc. In Teochew, the basic demonstratives are *tsi2* 只 and *heu2* 許, which are roughly equivalent to “this” and “that” in English. The other demonstratives are derived from these two words.

*tsi2 / heu2* • *zi2 / he2* • 只 / 許 • “This / that”
-------------------------------------------------------

*Tsi2* 只 “this” is the proximal demonstrative, meaning that it refers to something that is close to the speaker, whether literally close by in space or in time, or figuratively close to the topic being discussed, somehow being “at hand”.

*Heu2* 許 “that” is the distal demonstrative, referring to something literally or figuratively “over there”.

The Mandarin equivalents are *zhè* 這 and *nà* 那 respectively. 這 in Teochew is pronounced *tse2*, and is sometimes used in place of 只 to write *tsi2*.

### *...kai5* • *...gai5* • ...個 • “this / that” + noun

*Tsi2* and *heu2* are combined with *kai5* 個 or an appropriate classifier for the basic meaning of “this” or “that”, referring to a noun. (See [“Classifiers and 個 kai5”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/classifiers.md %}))

> **Tsi2kai5** si7 ua2 soi2hang3 seung2 kai7 ang1gong1kiar2.
>
> **Zi2gai5** si7 ua2 soi2hang3 seng2 gai7 ang1gong1gian2.
>
> 只個 是 我 細漢 耍 個 尪公囝。
>
> **This-CL** is I childhood play REL doll.
>
> This is the doll that I played with as a child.
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Khiek4 **heu2pung6** tseu1 kue3lai7.
>
> Kiêg4 **he2bung6** ze1 guê3lai7.
>
> 挈 許本 書 過來。
>
> Bring **that-CL** book over-here.
>
> Bring that book here.
>
> \*\*\*
>
> I1 siang7 lou2 **tsi2tiou7** kung1.
>
> I1 siang7 lou2 **zi2diou7** gung1.
>
> 伊 上 滷 只條 裙。
>
> He most dislike **this-CL** dress.
>
> He hates this dress the most.

### *...tsho’4* • *...coh4* • ...撮 • “these / those” + noun

Just as *kai5* 個 is the default classifier for single objects, *tsho’4* 撮 is the default classifier for plurals (see [“Classifiers and 個 kai5”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/classifiers.md %})). *Tsi2tsho’4* and *heu2tsho’4* therefore mean “these” and “those” respectively.

Lim 1886 gives a pronunciation *tsi2tshuar6kai7* for “these” / “those”, and transcribes *tshuar6* as 賤.

### *...tsho’8mue’8* • *...coh8muêh8* • ...撮物 • “these / those things”

To refer “these / those things” without naming them.

### *...ser1* • *...sên1* • ...生 • “in this / that manner”

*Tsi2ser1* 只生 and *heu2ser1* are also pronounced *tsie2ser1* 照生 (or *tse2ser1* 這生) and *hie2ser1* ～生 (see *tsie2 / hie2* below). Used to indicate how something is done, or the manner in which it is done.

> I1nang7 ***heu2ser1*** thak8kiu5 si7 boi7 iar5-kai7 la7.
>
> I1nang7 ***he2sên1*** tag8giu5 si7 bhoi7 ian5-gai7 la7.
>
> 伊儂 ***許生*** 踢球 是 袂 贏個 啦。
>
> They ***that-manner*** kick-ball is NEG win-REL SFP.
>
> They won’t win by playing football that way.
>
> \*\*\*
>
*Tsi2ser1* can also be an adverb meaning “to such an extent”.

> I1 tso2ni7 ***tsie2ser1*** mak8siap4?
>
> I1 zo2ni7 ***ziê2sên1*** mag8siab4?
>
> 伊 做呢 ***照生*** 目澀？
>
> He why ***so-much*** sleepy?
>
> Why is he so sleepy?

The Hokkien equivalent of *tsie2ser1* is *án-ne* 按呢.

Lim 1886 gives a somewhat different explanation for the hi / hio / hia series:

> tsio / hio – equivalent to tsiko / heuko in the sense of “here” / “there”

> tsia / hia – equivalent to tsikai / heukai in the sense of “this” / “that”



*tsie2 / hie2* • *ziê2 / hiê2* • 照 / ～ • “these / those” or “here / there”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are derived from a fusion of *tsi2* 只 / *heu2* 許 with another word, which may be the collective classifier *ko3* 塊 (Xu 2007). Therefore *tsie2* and *hie2* can mean “these” and “those” respectively.

> ***Tsie2*** tseu1 si7 ua2 a1tse2 sang7-kai7.
>
> ***Ziê2*** ze1 si7 ua2 a1zê2 sang7-gai7.
>
> ***照*** 書 是 我 阿姐 送 個。
>
> ***These*** book is I older-sister gift REL.
>
> These books were a gift from my older sister.

*Tsie2* / *hie2* can also be combined with classifiers, including *tsho’4*, which is also a collective classifier for multiples of things.

> ***Hie2tsho’4*** sar1khou3 ua2 khiek4 kheu2 soi2-liou7.
>
> ***Hiê2coh4*** san1kou3 ua2 kiêg4 ke2 soi2-liou7.
>
> ***～撮*** 衫褲 我 挈 去 洗 了。
>
> ***Those-pl.*** clothes I take go wash-PERF.
>
> I have brought those clothes away to be washed.

*Tsie2mue’4* / *hie2mue’4* “this thing” / “that thing” is like *tsi2kai5* / *heu2kai5*, referring to anything, not necessarily plural.

> ***Tsie2mue’4*** bo3ho6 tsiak4, hie2mue’4 iou6 u7 bi7sou3.
>
> ***Ziê2muêh4*** bho3ho6 ziag4, hiê2muêh4 iou6 u7 bhi7sou3.
>
> ***照物*** 無好 嚼，～物 夭 有 味素。
>
> ***This-thing*** not-good eat, that-thing more have flavor.
>
> This isn’t tasty, that has more flavor.

Another usage of *tsie2* / *hie2* is for “here” / “there” (Lim 1886), which also happens to be the other meaning for *tsi2ko3* / *heu2ko3* (see below).

*Tsie2lai6* / *hie2lai6* are used to mean “at home”, but depend on whether the speaker him- or herself is at home (Xu 2007).



*tsia2 / hia2* • *zia2 / hia2* • 者 / ～
----------------------------------------

> tsia2 / hia2 – this kind of / that kind of



Location and direction
----------------------

### *...ko3* • *...go3* • ...塊 • “here / there”

*tsi2ko3* 只塊 and *heu2ko3* 許塊 are the generic pronouns for “here” and “there”.

> Kie2 i1 mai2 to7 ***tsi2ko3*** tsiak4hung1.
>
> Giê2 i1 mai2 do7 ***zi2ko3*** ziag4hung1.
>
> 叫 伊 莫 在 ***只塊*** 嚼薰。
>
> Call he NEG at ***here*** smoke.
>
> Tell him not to smoke here.

In addition, Teochew has other specific terms for indicating location. They are used with the verb *to6* 在 “to be at”.

These are formed by adding a suffix to *tsi2* or *heu2*. The suffix typically cannot stand as a word by itself. For example one could say:

> Ua2 to7 ***heu6khau2*** tang2 leu3.
>
> Ua2 do7 ***he6kao2*** dang2 le3.
>
> 我 在 ***許口*** 等 汝。
>
> I at ***there*** wait you.
>
> I'll wait for you over there.

But *khau2* cannot stand by itself:

> \* Ua2 to7 ***khau2*** tang2 leu3.
>
> \* Ua2 do7 ***kao2*** dang2 le3.
>
> \* 我 在 ***口*** 等 汝。

Furthermore, many of these suffixes can be combined with words other than *tsi2* and *heu2* to describe different kinds of locations:

> Ua2 to7 ghua7-***khau2*** tang2 leu3.
>
> Ua2 do7 gua7-***kao2*** dang2 le3.
>
> 我 在 外-***口*** 等 汝。
>
> I at outside wait you.
>
> I'll wait for you outside.

> \*\*\*

> Ua2 to7 tshu2-***lai6***.
>
> Ua2 do7 cu2-***lai6***
>
> 我 在 厝-***內***。
>
> I at house-***inside***.
>
> I'm in the house.

> \*\*\*

> I1 muar6zik8 kheu2 huang1-***poih5***.
>
> I1 muan6rig8 ke2 huang1-***boin5***
>
> 伊 明日 去 番-***爿***
>
> He tomorrow go foreign-***place***.
>
> He’s going abroad tomorrow.

> \*\*\*

> Pheng7kuaih2 to7 ap8-***toih2***.
>
> Pêng8guain2 do7 ab8-***doin2***
>
> 蘋果 在 盒-***底***。
>
> Apple in box-***inside***.
>
> The apple is in the box.

The following are some more examples of location suffixes.

### *...lai6* • *...lai6* • ...內 • “inside”

Used to refer to locations that are indoors, e.g. within a house. It can also figuratively refer to “this household” or “those people”.

> Leu2 to7 tsi2-***lai6*** tang2 tsek4e7, ho2mo2?
>
> Le2 do7 zi2-***lai6*** dang2 zêg4ê7, ho2mo2?
>
> 汝 在 只-***內*** 等 一下，好孬？
>
> You at in-***here*** wait a-moment, good-NEG?
>
> Why don’t you wait in here for a moment?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Heu2-***lai6***-kai7 tsau6kiar2 kuai1-kue7 leu2.
>
> He2-***lai6***-gai7 zau6gian2 guai1-guê7 le2.
>
> 許-***內*** 個 走囝 乖過 汝。
>
> In-***there*** GEN daughter obedient-more you.
>
> Their daughter is more well-behaved than you.
