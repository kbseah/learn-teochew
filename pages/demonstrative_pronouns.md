Demonstrative pronouns
========
{: .no_toc}

Demonstrative pronouns are words like “this” and “that”, which point to
specific things, persons, etc. In Teochew, the basic demonstratives are *zi2*
只 and *he2* 許, which are roughly equivalent to “this” and “that” in English.
The other demonstratives are derived from these two words.

*zi2 / he2* • 只 / 許 • “This / that”
-----------------------------------

*Zi2* 只 “this” is the proximal demonstrative, meaning that it refers to
something that is close to the speaker, whether literally close by in space or
in time, or figuratively close to the topic being discussed, somehow being “at
hand”.

*He2* 許 “that” is the distal demonstrative, referring to something literally
or figuratively “over there”.

The Mandarin equivalents are *zhè* 這 and *nà* 那 respectively. 這 in Teochew
is pronounced *zê2*, and is sometimes used in place of 只 to write *zi2*.

### *...gai5* • ...個 • “this / that” + noun

*Zi2* and *he2* are combined with *gai5* 個 or an appropriate classifier for
the basic meaning of “this” or “that”, referring to a noun. (See [“Classifiers
and 個 kai5”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/classifiers.md %}))

> **tsi⁵³kai⁵⁵** si¹¹ ua⁵³ soi⁵³haŋ²¹³ sɯŋ⁵³ kai¹¹ aŋ³³koŋ³³kĩã⁵³

>
> *只個* 是 我 細漢 耍 個 尪公囝。
>
> **This-CL** is I childhood play REL doll.
>
> This is the doll that I played with as a child.
>

>
> 伊 上 滷 *只條* 裙。
>
> He most dislike **this-CL** dress.
>
> He hates this dress the most.

### *...coh4* • ...撮 • “these / those” + noun

Just as *gai5* 個 is the default classifier for single objects, *coh4* 撮 is
the default classifier for plurals (see
[“Classifiers and 個 gai5”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/classifiers.md %})).
*Zi2(6)coh4* and *he2(6)coh4* therefore mean “these” and “those” respectively.

Lim (1886) gives a pronunciation *zi2cuan2(6)gai5* for “these” / “those”, and
transcribes *cuan2* as 賤.

### *...coh4(8)muêh8* • ...撮物 • “these / those things”

To refer “these / those things” without naming them.

### *...sên1* • ...生 • “in this / that manner”

*Zi2sên1* 只生 and *he2sên1* are also pronounced *ziê2sên1* 照生 (or *zê2sen1*
這生) and *hiê2sen1* ～生 (see *ziê2 / hiê2* below). Used to indicate how
something is done, or the manner in which it is done.

> i³³naŋ¹¹ **hɯ⁵³sẽ³³** tʰak⁵kiu⁵⁵ si¹¹ boi¹¹ ĩã⁵⁵kai¹¹ la¹¹
>
> I1nang5(7) **he2sên1** tag4(8)giu5 si6(7) bhoi6(7) ian5-gai5(7) la7.
>
> 伊儂 *許生* 踢球 是 袂 贏個 啦。
>
> They **that-manner** kick-ball is NEG win-REL SFP.
>
> They won’t win by playing football that way.
>
> \*\*\*
>
*Zi2sên1* can also be an adverb meaning “to such an extent”.

> i³³ tso⁵³ni¹¹ **tsie⁵³sẽ³³** mak²siap²
>
> I1 zo3(2)ni5(7) **ziê2sên1** mag8(4)siab4?
>
> 伊 做呢 *照生* 目澀？
>
> He why **so-much** sleepy?
>
> Why is he so sleepy?

The Hokkien equivalent of *ziê2sên1* is *án-ne* 按呢.

Lim (1886) gives a somewhat different explanation for the hi / hio / hia series:

> tsio / hio – equivalent to tsiko / heuko in the sense of “here” / “there”

> tsia / hia – equivalent to tsikai / heukai in the sense of “this” / “that”



*ziê2 / hiê2* • 照 / ～ • “these / those” or “here / there”
---------------------------------------------------------

These two words are derived from a fusion of *zi2* 只 / *he2* 許 with another
word, which may be the collective classifier *go3* 塊 (Xu 2007). Therefore
*ziê2* and *hiê2* can mean “these” and “those” respectively.

> **tsie⁵³** tsɯ³³ si¹¹ ua⁵³ a³³tse³⁵ saŋ¹¹kai¹¹
>
> **Ziê2** ze1 si6(7) ua2 a1zê2(6) sang3-gai5(7).
>
> *照* 書 是 我 阿姐 送 個。
>
> **These** book is I older-sister gift REL.
>
> These books were a gift from my older sister.

*Ziê2 / hiê2* can also be combined with classifiers, including *coh4* 撮, which
is also a collective classifier for multiples of things.

> **hie⁵³tsʰoʔ²** sã³³kʰou²¹³ ua⁵³ kʰiek² kʰɯ⁵³ soi⁵³liou¹¹
>
> **Hiê2coh4(8)** san1kou3 ua2 kiêg8(4) ke3(2) soi2-liou7.
>
> *～撮* 衫褲 我 挈 去 洗 了。
>
> **Those-pl.** clothes I take go wash-PERF.
>
> I have brought those clothes away to be washed.

*Ziê2muêh8 / hiê2muêh8* “this thing” / “that thing” is like *zi2gai5 /
he2gai5*, referring to anything, not necessarily plural.

> **tsie⁵³mueʔ²** bo¹¹ho³⁵ tsiaʔ⁵ / hie⁵³mueʔ² iou³⁵ u¹¹ bi¹¹sou²¹³
>
> **Ziê2muêh8(4)** bho5(7)ho2(6) ziah8, hiê2muêh8(4) iou1 u6(7) bhi5(7)sou3.
>
> *照物* 無好 食，～物 夭 有 味素。
>
> **This-thing** not-good eat, that-thing more have flavor.
>
> This isn’t tasty, that has more flavor.

Another usage of *ziê2 / hiê2* is for “here” / “there” (Lim 1886), which also
happens to be the other meaning for *zi2go3 / he2go3* (see below).

*Ziê2lai6* / *hiê2lai6* are used to mean “at home”, but depend on whether the
speaker him- or herself is at home (Xu 2007).



*zia2 / hia2* • 者 / ～
---------------------

> *tsia⁵³ / hia⁵³* • *zia2 / hia2* • this kind of / that kind of



Location and direction
----------------------

### *...go3* • ...塊 • “here / there”

*Zi2go3* 只塊 and *he2go3* 許塊 are the generic pronouns for “here” and “there”.

> kie⁵³ i³³ mai⁵³ to¹¹ **tsi⁵³ko²¹³** tsiaʔ²huŋ³³
>
> Giê3(2) i1 mai3(2) do6(7) **zi2ko3** ziah8(4)hung1.
>
> 叫 伊 莫 在 *只塊* 食薰。
>
> Call he NEG at **here** smoke.
>
> Tell him not to smoke here.

In addition, Teochew has other specific terms for indicating location. They are
used with the verb *do6* 在 “to be at”.

These are formed by adding a suffix to *zi2* or *he2*. The suffix typically
cannot stand as a word by itself. For example one could say:

> ua⁵³ to¹¹ **hɯ³⁵kʰau⁵³** taŋ³⁵ lɯ⁵³
>
> Ua2 do6(7) **he2(6)kao2** dang2(6) le2.
>
> 我 在 *許口* 等 汝。
>
> I at **there** wait you.
>
> I'll wait for you over there.

But *kao2* cannot stand by itself:

> \* ua⁵³ to¹¹ **kʰau⁵³** taŋ³⁵ lɯ⁵³
>
> \* Ua2 do6(7) **kao2** dang2(6) le2.
>
> \* 我 在 *口* 等 汝。

Furthermore, many of these suffixes can be combined with words other than *zi2*
and *he2* to describe different kinds of locations:

> ua⁵³ to¹¹ gua¹¹**kʰau⁵³** taŋ³⁵ lɯ⁵³
>
> Ua2 do6(7) ghua7-**kao2** dang2(6) le2.
>
> 我 在 外-*口* 等 汝。
>
> I at outside wait you.
>
> I'll wait for you outside.

> \*\*\*

> ua⁵³ to¹¹ tsʰu⁵³**lai³⁵**
>
> Ua2 do6(7) cu3(2)-**lai6**
>
> 我 在 厝-*內*。
>
> I at house-**inside**.
>
> I'm in the house.

> \*\*\*

> i³³ mũã³⁵zik⁵ kʰɯ⁵³ huaŋ³³**põĩ⁵⁵**
>
> I1 muan2(6)rig8 ke3(2) huang1-**boin5**
>
> 伊 明日 去 番-*爿*
>
> He tomorrow go foreign-**place**.
>
> He’s going abroad tomorrow.

> \*\*\*

> pʰeŋ¹¹kũãĩ⁵³ to¹¹ ap²**tõĩ⁵³**
>
> Pêng5(7)guain2 do6(7) ab8(4)-**doin2**
>
> 蘋果 在 盒-*底*。
>
> Apple in box-**inside**.
>
> The apple is in the box.

The following are some more examples of location suffixes.

### *...lai6* • ...內 • “inside”

Used to refer to locations that are indoors, e.g. within a house. It can also
figuratively refer to “this household” or “those people”.

> lɯ⁵³ to¹¹ tsi³⁵**lai¹¹** taŋ⁵³ tsek²e¹¹ / ho⁵³mo⁵³
>
> Le2 do6(7) zi2(6)-**lai6(7)** dang2 zêg8(4)ê7, ho2mo2?
>
> 汝 在 只-*內* 等 一下，好孬？
>
> You at in-**here** wait a-moment, good-NEG?
>
> Why don’t you wait in here for a moment?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> hɯ⁵³**lai³⁵** kai¹¹ tsau³⁵kĩã⁵³ kuai³³kue⁵³ lɯ⁵³
>
> He2(6)-**lai6**-gai5(7) zao2(6)gian2 guai1-guê3(2) le2.
>
> 許-*內* 個 走囝 乖過 汝。
>
> In-**there** GEN daughter obedient-more you.
