Terms of address
================
{: .no_toc}

Like all Chinese languages, Teochew has a rich vocabulary for describing family relations. This is an important topic for many heritage speakers, since the extended family and older relatives are likely to be the context in which they are most likely to encounter the language. Titles and forms of polite address, as well as commonly encountered surnames, are also useful to know and described here.

Titles
------

Like other Chinese languages, formal or polite titles follow after a person’s surname, e.g. *Tang5*-***thai2thai3*** 陳太太 “**Mrs** Tan”. Heritage speakers may be more familiar with kinship terms, as they speak the language primarily at home and with relatives.

### Simulated kinship terms

“Simulated kinship” refers to the use of kinship terms to address strangers or persons who are not one’s actual blood relatives, as a means of conveying familiarity and respect. These terms are not combined with surnames. The original meanings are also given in the table below. Compare the usage of “uncle” and “auntie” in Singapore English and other regional English dialects like Indian English.

| Definition                                 | Flattened IPA | Peng'im | Characters |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------|
| older man (father’s older brother)                     | a1pe’4  | a1bêh4  | 阿伯 |
| older man (father’s younger brother)                   | a1tsek4 | a1zêg4  | 阿叔 |
| older woman (father’s older brother’s wife)            | a1m2    | a1m2    | 阿姆 |
| older woman (father’s younger brother’s wife)          | a1sim2  | a1sim2  | 阿嬸 |
| man of similar age, or slightly older (older brother)  | a1hiar1 | a1hian1 | 阿兄 |
| woman of similar age, or slightly older (older sister) | a1tse2  | a1zê2   | 阿姐 |
| boy, younger male (younger brother)                    | a1ti6   | a1di6   | 阿弟 |
| girl, younger female (younger sister)                  | a1mue6  | a1muê6  | 阿妹 |

The terms *a1ti6* and *a1mue6* may sound condescending, if the speaker is not much older than the person being addressed.

Familial terms
--------------

In Chinese families, elder relations are not typically referred to by their personal names, but by their kinship to the speaker. Where the kinship term could refer to more than one person, such as when a parent has several siblings, the term is qualified by stating their birth order, e.g. *tua7kou1* 大姑 “father’s eldest sister”, *sar1ku6* 三舅 “mother’s third brother” (see [Numbers and Counting]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/numbers.md %})). Kinship terms can also be reduplicated, e.g. *kou1kou1* 姑姑 “auntie”, *ku7ku6* 舅舅 “uncle”, or prefixed with *a1* 阿, when there is no ambiguity or when addressing the person directly. When personal names or nicknames are combined with kinship terms, the kinship term comes after the name, e.g. Florence *kou1kou1* “Aunt Florence”.

Common surnames

The distribution of surnames is not uniform across different regions of China. The following are the twenty most common surnames in the Teochew region. The first twelve in the list were the surnames represented in the founding committee of the Ngee Ann Kongsi 義安公司, a Teochew regional association, when it was established in Singapore in 1830.

The “common romanization” column shows how these surnames are often rendered in Singapore and Malaysia. However, some of these may be confused for names in other dialects that are romanized with the same spelling:

“Heng”: *Heng5* 王 (Teochew) vs. *Hêng* 邢 (Hokkien). The Teochew pronunciation of 邢 is *Hiar5*.

“Chan”: *Tsang5* 曾 (Teochew) vs. *Chàhn* 陳 (Cantonese). The Teochew pronunciation of 陳 is *Tang5*.

The Speak Mandarin Campaign, launched in 1979 by the Singapore government, promoted the use of Mandarin over other Chinese languages in Singapore, to the extent that parents were encouraged to register the names of their children in Mandarin with Hanyu Pinyin romanization. As a result, many children born in the 1980s and 90s have surnames that differ from that of their parents in the romanized form.

### Surnames with alternative pronunciations (又讀)

Several Chinese characters have different pronunciations depending on the meaning and context. For example, 車 is pronounced *jū* in Mandarin when it means “chariot” in classical texts, but is pronounced *chē* for other uses, and in modern Mandarin. (See also “Literary vs. vernacular pronunciations” under [“Pronunciation”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/pronunciation.md %}).)

This applies to several surnames, which are pronounced one way when part of someone’s name, but in another way when part of a ‘normal’ word. One example is the name of the Singapore Teochew businessman Lien Ying Chow 連瀛洲 (M: *Lián Yíngzhōu*), pronounced *Hiar7 Iong7tsiu1* in Teochew. The character 連 is usually pronounced *liang5*, but when used as a surname should be pronounced *Hiar5*. (See [“Interview with Chua Hong Kee”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/texts/chua_hong_kee.md %}).) The following list is not exhaustive.
