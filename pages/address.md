Terms of address
================
{: .no_toc}

Like all Chinese languages, Teochew has a rich vocabulary for describing family
relations. This is an important topic for many heritage speakers, since the
extended family and older relatives are likely to be the context in which they
are most likely to encounter the language. Titles and forms of polite address,
as well as commonly encountered surnames, are also useful to know and described
here.

Titles
------

Like other Chinese languages, formal or polite titles follow after a person’s
surname, e.g. *Dang5*-***tai3(2)tai3*** 陳太太 “**Mrs** Tan”. Heritage speakers
may be more familiar with kinship terms, as they speak the language primarily
at home and with relatives.

\* regional term used in Singapore and Malaysia

### Simulated kinship terms

“Simulated kinship” refers to the use of kinship terms to address strangers or
persons who are not one’s actual blood relatives, as a means of conveying
familiarity and respect. These terms are not combined with surnames. The
original meanings are also given in the table below. Compare the usage of
“uncle” and “auntie” in Singapore English and other regional English dialects
like Indian English.

| Definition                                             |  IPA | Peng'im | Characters |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|------|
| older man (father’s older brother)                     | a³³peʔ²  | a1bêh4  | 阿伯 |
| older man (father’s younger brother)                   | a³³tsek² | a1zêg4  | 阿叔 |
| older woman (father’s older brother’s wife)            | a³³m⁵³   | a1m2    | 阿姆 |
| older woman (father’s younger brother’s wife)          | a³³sim⁵³ | a1sim2  | 阿嬸 |
| man of similar age, or slightly older (older brother)  | a³³hĩã³³ | a1hian1 | 阿兄 |
| woman of similar age, or slightly older (older sister) | a³³tse⁵³ | a1zê2   | 阿姐 |
| boy, younger male (younger brother)                    | a³³ti³⁵  | a1di6   | 阿弟 |
| girl, younger female (younger sister)                  | a³³mue³⁵ | a1muê6  | 阿妹 |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|------|

The terms *a1ti6* and *a1muê6* may sound condescending, if the speaker is not
much older than the person being addressed.

Familial terms
--------------

In Chinese families, elder relations are not typically referred to by their
personal names, but by their kinship to the speaker. Where the kinship term
could refer to more than one person, such as when a parent has several
siblings, the term is qualified by stating their birth order, e.g. *dua7gou1*
大姑 “father’s eldest sister”, *san1gu6* 三舅 “mother’s third brother” (see
[Numbers and Counting]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/numbers.md %})). Kinship
terms can also be reduplicated, e.g. *gou1gou1* 姑姑 “auntie”, *gu6(7)gu6* 舅舅
“uncle”, or prefixed with *a1* 阿, when there is no ambiguity or when
addressing the person directly. When personal names or nicknames are combined
with kinship terms, the kinship term comes after the name, e.g. *Florence
gou1gou1* “Aunt Florence”.

Common surnames

The distribution of surnames is not uniform across different regions of China.
The following are the twenty most common surnames in the Teochew region. The
first twelve in the list were the surnames represented in the founding
committee of the Ngee Ann Kongsi 義安公司, a Teochew regional association, when
it was established in Singapore in 1830.

The “common romanization” column shows how these surnames are often rendered in
Singapore and Malaysia. However, some of these may be confused for names in
other dialects that are romanized with the same spelling:

“Heng”: *Hêng5* 王 (Teochew) vs. *Hêng* 邢 (Hokkien). The Teochew pronunciation of 邢 is *Hian5*.

“Chan”: *Zang5* 曾 (Teochew) vs. *Chàhn* 陳 (Cantonese). The Teochew pronunciation of 陳 is *Dang5*.

The Speak Mandarin Campaign, launched in 1979 by the Singapore government,
promoted the use of Mandarin over other Chinese languages in Singapore, to the
extent that parents were encouraged to register the names of their children in
Mandarin with Hanyu Pinyin romanization. As a result, many children born in the
1980s and 90s have surnames that differ from that of their parents in the
romanized form.

### Surnames with alternative pronunciations (又讀)

Several Chinese characters have different pronunciations depending on the
meaning and context. For example, 車 is pronounced *jū* in Mandarin when it
means “chariot” in classical texts, but is pronounced *chē* for other uses, and
in modern Mandarin. (See also “Literary vs. vernacular pronunciations” under
[“Pronunciation”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/pronunciation.md %}).)

This applies to several surnames, which are pronounced one way when part of
someone’s name, but in another way when part of a ‘normal’ word. One example is
the name of the Singapore Teochew businessman Lien Ying Chow 連瀛洲 (M: *Lián
Yíngzhōu*), pronounced *Hian5(7) Iong5(7)ziu1* in Teochew. The character 連 is
usually pronounced *liang5*, but when used as a surname should be pronounced
*Hian5*. (See 
[“Interview with Chua Hong Kee”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/texts/chua_hong_kee.md %}).)
