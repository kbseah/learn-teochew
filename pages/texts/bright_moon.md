The Moon Shines Brightly (Nursery Rhyme)
----------------------------------------

「月光光」 (“The Moon Shines Brightly”) is a nursery rhyme from the Yue and Min speaking regions of Southern China. There are [different versions](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/月光光_(儿歌)) in the various dialects from these language families, including Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew, but all start with the line “月光光” (“the moon shines brightly...”).

The version below is adapted from a Gêg-ion (揭陽 Jiéyáng) dialect speaker's version, recorded by Tung (1959). The Chinese characters used by Tung have been changed in some places to be consistent with the usage in this Guide and other sources, and a small typo fixed.
