Texts
=====

Learning Teochew can be difficult because it is mostly a spoken language, and
there are few printed texts in the language.

Here is a selection of texts, either from published sources or transcribed from
videos or audio recordings, to show Teochew in use, beyond the short example
sentences in the study guide.

Each text is transcribed in “flattened” IPA and Guangdong Peng’im (see
[Pronunciation and Orthography](pages/pronunciation.md)) as well as Chinese
characters, along with a rough English translation.

If you would like to contribute interesting texts or transcriptions, please [get
in touch!](https://forms.gle/igjwwiz2z2Dpr3SE6)
