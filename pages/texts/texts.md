Texts
=====

Learning Teochew can be difficult because it is mostly a spoken language, and
there are few printed texts in the language.

Here is a selection of texts, either from published sources or transcribed from
videos or audio recordings, to show Teochew in use, beyond the short example
sentences in the study guide.[^1]

Each text is transcribed in “flattened” IPA and Guangdong Peng’im (see
[Pronunciation and Orthography](../pronunciation.md)) as well as Chinese
characters, along with a rough English translation.

If you would like to contribute interesting texts or transcriptions, please [get
