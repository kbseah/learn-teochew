The Rain is Falling (folksong)
------------------------------
{: .no_toc}

This is a folk song or nursery rhyme that begins with the line *hou6 loh8loh8*
雨落落 “the rain is falling”. Here are three different versions from three
collections. The basic story of the (short) folk song is the same in all three:
Grandpa catches a fish, Grandpa and Grandma disagree on what to do with it, and
they get into a fight.

This story is reminiscent of the Hokkien folk song [Thiⁿ
O͘-o͘](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/天烏烏) 天烏烏. In version 3 below, a
completely different folk song appears to have been fused onto the end of the
first, with a short transition.

The first two versions were originally published in Chinese characters only
(reproduced below). They illustrate different choices in transcribing specific
words that do not have a standard character, like ain3 (“want”) – 欲 / 要. The
third version was originally published as a transcription in the International
Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), with a Mandarin translation when a corresponding
character was not available or unknown. To all three versions, a transcription
in Pêng’im has been added.
