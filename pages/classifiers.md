Classifiers
-----------

Classifiers, also known as “measure words” 量詞, are a distinctive feature of Chinese languages.

In English, mass nouns (uncountable nouns) such as “water” or “flour” are usually qualified with a unit of measure or the container used to hold them, e.g. “a liter of water”, “a cup of flour”. Measure words are also used to refer to groups, especially of animals: “a pride of lions”, “a murder of ravens”.

In Chinese languages, however, all nouns, whether countable or uncountable, take a classifier. The most common “generic” classifier is *kai5* 個, which is cognate to Mandarin *gè*. However there are some important differences, described below under the section on “*kai5* • *gai5* • 個”.

### How to use classifiers

All nouns take a classifier. There are some general patterns, but it can be difficult to guess which is the correct classifier for a given noun. A list of common classifiers is given below.

Classifiers are used when counting. The classifier follows the number but comes before any adjectives.

> A1-Seng5 u7 sar1-***kai7*** hiar1ti6.
>
> A1-Sêng5 u7 san1-***gai7*** hian1di6.
>
> 阿誠 有 三***個*** 兄弟。
>
> Ah-Seng have three-***CL*** brothers.
>
> Ah Seng has three brothers.

Classifiers are used together with demonstratives (see [“Demonstrative pronouns”](demonstrative_pronouns.md)) when referring to specific objects (“this”, “that”, “each”, “every”).

> Heu2-***tiou7*** lou7 tsing1 teung5.
>
> He2-***diou7*** lou7 zing1 deng5.
>
> 許***條*** 路 真 長。
>
> That-***CL*** road very long.
>
> That road is very long.

Classifiers are used in questions (see [“Questions”](questions.md)) when asking about specific objects (“which”, “how many”).

> Ap8-toih2 u7 kui6-***liap4*** neung6?
>
> Ab8-doin2 u7 gui6-***liab4*** neng6?
>
> 盒底 有 幾***粒*** 卵？
>
> Box-inside have how-many-***CL*** eggs?
>
> How many eggs are in the box?

### Differences to Mandarin classifiers

The basic usage of classifiers in Teochew, as described above, is the same as in Mandarin. However there are some uses of classifiers that are different from Mandarin.

#### Definite noun with classifier

A “bare” classifier without a number or prefix can be used before a noun to indicate the definite form (“the cat”, “the hat”).

> ***Teng6***-bo7 boi7ngia2, ua2 mo6 ti3.
>
> ***Dêng6***-bho7 bhoi7ngia2, ua2 mo6 di3.
>
> ***頂***帽 無雅， 我 孬 戴。
>
> ***CL***-hat NEG-elegant, I NEG wear.
>
> The hat is not elegant, I won’t wear it.

This usage of a “bare” classifier is not found in Hokkien and related dialects from Fujian province, but is present in Teochew and Southern Min dialects in Guangdong province, possibly under the influence of Cantonese.


#### Genitive form with classifier

Classifiers can be used to form the genitive (possessive) form of a noun or pronoun. In Mandarin, the genitive form uses the marker *dè* 的 instead.

> [NOUN1]-[Classifier] [NOUN2]
>
> Ua2-***pung6*** tseu1.
>
> Ua2-***bung6*** ze1.
>
> 我***本*** 書。
>
> I-***CL*** book.
>
> My book

In this case, the classifier *pung2* 本 is the specific classifier used for the noun *tseu1* 書 (“book”). To form the genitive, the generic classifier *kai5* 個 can also be used, regardless of what classifier the noun usually takes.

> [NOUN1]-[kai5 個] [NOUN2]
>
> Ua2-***kai7*** tseu1.
>
> Ua2-***gai7*** ze1.
>
> 我***個*** 書。

When coming before the noun (the “attributive” position), both *ua2-pung2* and *ua2-kai5* can be used. However their meaning is slightly different (see Xu 2007, pg 81).

When coming after the noun (the “predicative” position), only the *kai5* form can be used. It also has to be linked to the noun with *si6* 是 (“is, to be”, the copula).

> \*Tsi2-pung6 tseu1 si7 ua2-***pung2***. [incorrect]
>
> \*Zi2-bung6 ze1 si7 ua2-***bung2***.
>
> \*只本 書 是 我***本***。
>
> \*\*\*
>
> [NOUN] - [si6 是] - [NOUN/PRONOUN]-[kai5 個]
>
> Tsi2-pung6 tseu1 si7 ua2-***kai5***.
>
> Zi2-bung6 ze1 si7 ua2-***gai5***.
>
> 只本 書 是 我***個***。
>
> This-CL book is I-***KAI***.
>
> This book is mine.

### Common classifiers

Classifiers can be divided into two main classes: *mensural* classifiers, which apply to groups, collections, or measures of things that are not counted discretely, and *sortal* classifiers, which apply to discrete counted objects.

The most common classifier is *kai5* 個, which is cognate to Mandarin *gè*. It is the default classifier for people and things, when other classifiers are not applicable. Like the case in Mandarin, *kai5* is increasingly replacing the less-common classifiers. *kai5* also has other functions (see below).

For plurals, the default classifier is *tsho’4* 撮, used in a similar way to Mandarin *xiē* 些. *tsho’4* can be used for both people and inanimate objects.

A detailed discussion is found in Xu (2007). The following examples are mostly from Xu (2007) and Lim (1886).

#### Mensural classifiers

These include classifiers that refer to groups of things collectively, e.g. a herd of animals, things that are measured or in containers, e.g. a bowl of water, as well as the general purpose plural classifier.

#### Sortal classifiers

These refer to discrete objects that can be counted. They classify objects either by their use or by their shape. For example, the classifier *liap8* 粒 is used for round objects like fruit and eggs.

### Overlap between Teochew and Mandarin classifiers

Many classifiers in Teochew are used in the same way as their Mandarin cognates.

Some are unique to Teochew and/or Southern Min languages, e.g. *niar2* 領, *tsho’* 撮.

Teochew has fewer classifiers than Mandarin. Some Teochew classifiers cover nouns that would be served by a number of different Mandarin classifiers. For example, the Teochew classifier *tsia’8* 隻 partly overlaps with the Mandarin *zhī* 隻, but can also be used with things that would take a number of different classifiers in Mandarin:

> tsek4 **tsia’8** kau2 • zêg4 **ziah8** gao2 • 一 **隻** 狗 vs. yīzhīgǒu 一隻狗 (dog)
>
> tsek4 **tsia’8** tshia1 • zêg4 **ziah8** cia1 • 一 **隻** 車 vs. yījiàchē 一架車 (motor car)
>
> tsek4 **tsia’8** tsheung5 • zêg **ziah8** ceng5 • 一 **隻** 桌 vs. yīzuòzhuōzǐ 一座桌子 (table)
>
> tsek4 **tsia’8** tsung5 • zêg4 **ziah8** zung5 • 一 **隻** 船 vs. yītiáochuán 一條船 (boat)


*kai5* • *gai5* • 個
--------------------

The word *kai5* 個 has many functions in Teochew. Aside from being the most commonly-used classifier, it also functions as a marker for possession (e.g. to form possessive pronouns), attributive adjectives, relative clauses, and more. It is roughly equivalent to a combination of *gè* 個 and *de* 的 in Mandarin.

### Classifier

*kai5* can be used as a classifier just like any other discussed above.

> Ua2 thau7-tsoih5 u7 sar1-***kai7*** nang5.
>
> Ua2 tao7-zoin5 u7 san1-***gai7*** nang5.
>
> 我 頭前 有 三***個*** 儂。
>
> I ahead have three-***CL*** people.
>
> There are three people ahead of me.


### Genitive marker

Adding *kai5* to a noun or pronoun makes the genitive (also known as possessive) form. Other classifiers can also be used, however see the notes above under “Differences from Mandarin classifiers”.

See also the section “Possessive pronouns” under [“Personal pronouns”](personal_pronouns.md).

> Ua2-***kai7*** mue’4kiar6
>
> Ua2-***gai7*** muêh4gian6
>
> 我***個*** 物囝
>
> (1st person pronuon)-***GEN*** thing
>
> My thing
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Tsi2-pung6 tseu1 si7 i1-***kai5***.
>
> Zi2-bung6 ze1 si7 i1-***gai5***.
>
> 只本 書 是 伊***個***。
>
> This-CL book is (3rd person pronoun)-***GEN***.
>
> This is his book.

### Attributive adjective linker

An attributive adjective is an adjective that immediately precedes a noun. In Teochew, like Mandarin, when the adjective is a single syllable (written as a single character), there is often no need for a linker.

> I1 si7 ho6nang5.
>
> Tā shì hǎorén
>
> 他 是 好人
>
> He is good-person

However, when the adjective is more than a single syllable, it needs a linker. In Mandarin, this is *dè* 的, whereas in Teochew this is *kai5* 個.

> ADJ - ***kai5*** - NOUN
>
> Tsher1sek4-***kai7*** sar1
>
> Cên1sêg4-***gai7*** san1
>
> 青色***個*** 衫
>
> Green-***KAI*** clothes

<!--
情色個 無好 睇
香港個 朋友
-->

### Relative clause linker

Relative clauses in English typically follow the noun phrase that they are dependent on.

> The man ***who had been waiting outside*** has just gone.

In Teochew, like in Mandarin, relative clauses usually precede the noun, and is linked to the noun with *kai5* 個 (Mandarin would use *dè* 的). Because of this similarity to attributive adjectives (see above), both these functional roles are sometimes grouped together under the name “descriptive linker”.

> RELATIVE CLAUSE - *kai5* - NOUN ...
>
> *To7 gua7khau2 lo6tang2* ***kai7*** nang5 tu1tu1 teung2 kheu3.
>
> *Do7 ghua7kao2 lo6dang2* ***gai7*** nang5 du1du1 deng2 ke3.
>
> *在 外口 囉等* ***個*** 儂 堵堵 轉 去。
>
> *At outside PROG-wait* ***REL*** person INCP return go.
>
> The man who had been waiting outside has just gone.

### Nominalizing suffix

An adjective or adjective phrase can behave like a noun, by adding *kai5* as a suffix.

> Leu2 u7 ho6tsia’4***kai7*** bo5?
>
> Le2 u7 ho6ziah5***gai7*** bho5?
>
> 汝 有 好食***個*** 無？
>
> You have can-eat-***KAI*** don’t-have?
>
> Do you have something to eat?
