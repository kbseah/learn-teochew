Classifiers and *gai5* 個
=========================
{: .no_toc}

Classifiers, also known as “measure words” *liang6(7)se5* 量詞, are a
distinctive feature of Chinese languages.

In English, mass nouns (uncountable nouns) such as “water” or “flour” are
usually qualified with a unit of measure or the container used to hold them,
e.g. “a liter of water”, “a cup of flour”. Measure words are also used to refer
to groups, especially of animals: “a pride of lions”, “a murder of ravens”.

In Chinese languages, however, all nouns, whether countable or uncountable,
take a classifier. The most common “generic” classifier is *gai5* 個, which is
cognate to Mandarin *gè*. However in Teochew, this word also has several other
important functions that are not found in Mandarin. These are described below
under the section on “*gai5* • 個”.

### How to use classifiers

All nouns take a classifier. There are some general patterns, but it can be
difficult to guess which is the correct classifier for a given noun. A list of
common classifiers is given below.

Classifiers are used when counting. The classifier follows the number but comes
before any adjectives.

> a³³seŋ⁵⁵ u¹¹ sã³³ **kai¹¹** hĩã³³ti³⁵
>
> A1-Sêng5 u6(7) san1-**gai5(7)** hian1di6.
>
> 阿誠 有 三 *個* 兄弟。
>
> Ah-Seng have three-**CL** brothers.
>
> Ah Seng has three brothers.

Classifiers are used together with demonstratives (see [“Demonstrative
pronouns”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/demonstrative_pronouns.md %})) when
referring to specific objects (“this”, “that”, “each”, “every”).

> hɯ³⁵ **tiou¹¹** lou¹¹ tsiŋ³³ tɯŋ⁵⁵
>
> He2(6)-**diou5(7)** lou7 zing1 deng5.
>
> 許 *條* 路 真 長。
>
> That-**CL** road very long.
>
> That road is very long.

Classifiers are used in questions (see
[“Questions”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/questions.md %})) when asking
about specific objects (“which”, “how many”).

> ap² tõĩ⁵³ u¹¹ kui³⁵ **liap²** nɯŋ³⁵
>
> Ab8(4)-doin2 u6(7) gui2(6)-**liab8(4)** neng6?
>
> 盒底 有 幾 *粒* 卵？
>
> Box-inside have how-many-**CL** eggs?
>
> How many eggs are in the box?

### Differences to Mandarin classifiers

The basic usage of classifiers in Teochew, as described above, is the same as
in Mandarin. However there are some uses of classifiers that are different from
Mandarin.

#### Definite noun with classifier

A “bare” classifier without a number or prefix can be used before a noun to
indicate the definite form (“the cat”, “the hat”).

> **teŋ³⁵** bo¹¹ boi¹¹ŋia⁵³ / ua⁵³ mo³⁵ ti²¹³
>
> **Dêng2(6)**-bho7 bhoi6(7)ngia2, ua2 mo2(6) di3.
>
> *頂* 帽 無雅， 我 孬 戴。
>
> **CL**-hat NEG-elegant, I NEG wear.
>
> The hat is not elegant, I won’t wear it.

This usage of a “bare” classifier is not found in Hokkien and related dialects
from Fujian province, but is present in Teochew and Southern Min dialects in
Guangdong province, possibly under the influence of Cantonese.


#### Genitive form with classifier

Classifiers can be used to form the genitive (possessive) form of a noun or
pronoun. In Mandarin, the genitive form uses the marker *dè* 的 instead.

> [NOUN1]-[Classifier] [NOUN2]
>
> ua⁵³ **puŋ³⁵** tsɯ³³
>
> Ua2-**bung2(6)** ze1.
>
> 我 *本* 書。
>
> I-**CL** book.
>
> My book

In this case, the classifier *bung2* 本 is the specific classifier used for the
noun *ze1* 書 (“book”). To form the genitive, the generic classifier *gai5* 個
can also be used, regardless of what classifier the noun usually takes.

> [NOUN1]-[kai5 個] [NOUN2]
>
> ua⁵³ **kai¹¹** tsɯ³³
>
> Ua2-**gai5(7)** ze1.
>
> 我 *個* 書。

When coming before the noun (the “attributive” position), both *ua2-bung2* and
*ua2-gai5* can be used. However their meaning is slightly different (see Xu
2007, pg 81).

When coming after the noun (the “predicative” position), only the *gai5* form
can be used. It also has to be linked to the noun with *si6* 是 (“is, to be”,
the copula).

> \*tsi⁵³ puŋ³⁵ tsɯ³³ si¹¹ ua⁵³ **puŋ⁵³** [incorrect]
>
> \*Zi2-bung2(6) ze1 si6(7) ua2-**bung2**.
>
> \*只本 書 是 我 *本*。
>
> \*\*\*
>
> [NOUN] - [si6 是] - [NOUN/PRONOUN]-[gai5 個]
>
> tsi⁵³ puŋ³⁵ tsɯ³³ si¹¹ ua⁵³ **kai⁵⁵**
>
> Zi2-bung2(6) ze1 si6(7) ua2-**gai5**.
>
> 只本 書 是 我 *個*。
>
> This-CL book is I-**GAI**.
>
> This book is mine.

### Common classifiers

Classifiers can be divided into two main classes: *mensural* classifiers, which
apply to groups, collections, or measures of things that are not counted
discretely, and *sortal* classifiers, which apply to discrete counted objects.

The most common classifier is *gai5* 個, which is cognate to Mandarin *gè*. It
is the default classifier for people and things, when other classifiers are not
applicable. Like the case in Mandarin, *gai5* is increasingly replacing the
less-common classifiers. *gai5* also has other functions (see below).

For plurals, the default classifier is *coh4* 撮, used in a similar way to
Mandarin *xiē* 些. *coh4* can be used for both people and inanimate objects.

A detailed discussion is found in Xu (2007). The following examples are mostly
from Xu (2007) and Lim (1886).

#### Mensural classifiers

These include classifiers that refer to groups of things collectively, e.g. a
herd of animals, things that are measured or in containers, e.g. a bowl of
water, as well as the general purpose plural classifier.

#### Sortal classifiers

These refer to discrete objects that can be counted. They classify objects
either by their use or by their shape. For example, the classifier *liap8* 粒
is used for round objects like fruit and eggs.

### Overlap between Teochew and Mandarin classifiers

Many classifiers in Teochew are used in the same way as their Mandarin cognates.

Some are unique to Teochew and/or Southern Min languages, e.g. *nian2* 領,
*coh4* 撮.

Teochew has fewer classifiers than Mandarin. Some Teochew classifiers cover
nouns that would be served by a number of different Mandarin classifiers. For
example, the Teochew classifier *ziah8* 隻 partly overlaps with the Mandarin
*zhī* 隻, but can also be used with things that would take a number of
different classifiers in Mandarin:

> tsek² **tsiaʔ²** kau⁵³ • zêg8(4) **ziah8(4)** gao2 • 一 *隻* 狗 vs. yīzhīgǒu 一隻狗 (dog)
>
> tsek² **tsiaʔ²** tsʰia³³ • zêg8(4) **ziah8(4)** cia1 • 一 *隻* 車 vs. yījiàchē 一架車 (motor car)
>
> tsek² **tsiaʔ²** tsʰɯŋ⁵⁵ • zêg8(4) **ziah8(4)** ceng5 • 一 *隻* 桌 vs. yīzuòzhuōzǐ 一座桌子 (table)
>
> tsek² **tsiaʔ²** tsuŋ⁵⁵ • zêg8(4) **ziah8(4)** zung5 • 一 *隻* 船 vs. yītiáochuán 一條船 (boat)


*gai5* • 個
--------------------

The word *gai5* 個 has many functions in Teochew. Aside from being the most
commonly-used classifier, it also functions as a marker for possession (e.g. to
form possessive pronouns), attributive adjectives, relative clauses, and more.
It is roughly equivalent to a combination of *gè* 個 and *de* 的 in Mandarin.

### Classifier

*gai5* can be used as a classifier just like any other discussed above.

> ua⁵³ tʰau¹¹ tsõĩ⁵⁵ u¹¹ sã³³ **kai¹¹** naŋ⁵⁵
>
> Ua2 tao5(7)-zoin5 u6(7) san1-**gai5(7)** nang5.
>
> 我 頭前 有 三 *個* 儂。
>
> I ahead have three-**CL** people.
>
> There are three people ahead of me.


### Genitive marker

Adding *gai5* to a noun or pronoun makes the genitive (also known as
possessive) form. Other classifiers can also be used, however see the notes
above under “Differences from Mandarin classifiers”.

See also the section “Possessive pronouns” under
[“Personal pronouns”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/personal_pronouns.md %}).

> ua⁵³ **kai¹¹** mueʔ²kĩã³⁵
>
> Ua2-**gai5(7)** muêh8(4)gian6
>
> 我 *個* 物囝
>
> (1st person pronuon)-**GEN** thing
>
> My thing
>
> \*\*\*
>
> tsi³⁵ puŋ³⁵ tsɯ³³ si¹¹ i³³ **kai⁵⁵**
>
> Zi2(6)-bung2(6) ze1 si6(7) i1-**gai5**.
>
> 只本 書 是 伊 *個*。
>
> This-CL book is (3rd person pronoun)-**GEN**.
>
> This is his book.

### Attributive adjective linker

An attributive adjective is an adjective that immediately precedes a noun. In
Teochew, like Mandarin, when the adjective is a single syllable (written as a
single character), there is often no need for a linker.

> i³³ si¹¹ ho³⁵naŋ⁵⁵
>
> I1 si6(7) ho2(6)nang5
>
> Tā shì hǎorén
>
> 他 是 好人
>
> He is good-person

However, when the adjective is more than a single syllable, it needs a linker.
In Mandarin, this is *dè* 的, whereas in Teochew this is *gai5* 個.

> ADJ - **gai5** - NOUN
>
> tsʰẽ³³sek² **kai¹¹** sã³³
>
> Cên1sêg8(4)-**gai5(7)** san1
>
> 青色 *個* 衫
>
> Green-**GAI** clothes

<!--
情色個 無好 睇
香港個 朋友
-->

### Relative clause linker

Relative clauses in English typically follow the noun phrase that they are
dependent on.

> The man ***who had been waiting outside*** has just gone.

In Teochew, like in Mandarin, relative clauses usually precede the noun, and is
linked to the noun with *gai5* 個 (Mandarin would use *dè* 的). Because of this
similarity to attributive adjectives (see above), both these functional roles
are sometimes grouped together under the name “descriptive linker”.

> RELATIVE CLAUSE - *gai5* - NOUN ...
>
> *To7 gua7khau2 lo6tang2* ***kai7*** nang5 tu1tu1 teung2 kheu3.
> *to¹¹ gua¹¹kʰau⁵³ lo⁵⁵taŋ⁵³* **kai¹¹** naŋ⁵⁵ tu³³tu³³ tɯŋ⁵³ kʰɯ²¹³
>
> *Do6(7) ghua7kao2 lo5dang2* **gai5(7)** nang5 du1du1 deng2 ke3.
>
> *在 外口 囉等* *個* 儂 堵堵 轉 去。
>
> *At outside PROG-wait* **REL** person INCP return go.
>
> The man who had been waiting outside has just gone.

### Nominalizing suffix

An adjective or adjective phrase can behave like a noun, by adding *kai5* as a
suffix.

> lɯ⁵³ u¹¹ ho³⁵tsiaʔ² **kai¹¹** bo⁵⁵
>
> Le2 u6(7) ho2(6)ziah8 **gai5(7)** bho5?
>
> 汝 有 好食 *個* 無？
>
> You have can-eat-**GAI** don’t-have?
>
> Do you have something to eat?
