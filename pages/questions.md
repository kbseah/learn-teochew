Questions
=========
{: .no_toc}

Questions can be broadly classified into two types: those which use interrogative pronouns (“who”, “what”, “which”, etc.) to request specific information, and those which can be replied with a simple “yes” or “no”.

Interrogative pronouns
----------------------

In English, the word order changes between a statement and its corresponding question form, such as in the following question-answer pair:

> **How many*** *apples *are there* on the table?
>
> *There are* **five** apples on the table.

The interrogative pronoun “how many” is brought to the front of the sentence when it is a question.

In Teochew and other Chinese languages, the interrogative pronoun and the noun that it is standing in for can simply be swapped out for each other, without changing the word order in the rest of the sentence:

> Leu2kai7 lau7pe7 si7 **ti7tiang1**?
>
> Le2gai7 lao7bê7 si7 **di7diang1**?
>
> 汝個 老爸 是 **哋㐱**？
>
> You-CL father is **who**?
>
> **Who** is your daddy?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Ua2kai7 lau7pe7 si7 **tang1kim1 tsong6li2**.
>
> Ua2gai7 lao7pê7 si7 **dang1gim1 zong6li2**.
>
> 我個 老爸 是 當今 **總理**。
>
> I-CL father is **present prime-minister**.
>
> My daddy is the **incumbent prime minister**.

The interrogative pronouns in Teochew are summarized in the following table:

|Definition      |Flattened IPA |Peng'im       |Character|
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| who, whose     | ti7tiang1    | di7diang1    | 哋㐱   |
| what           | si7mi’4      | si7mih4      | 是乜   |
| what           | ti7kai5      | di7gai5      | 哋個   |
| what thing     | mi’4kai5     | mih4gai5     | 乜個   |
| what manner    | mi’4ser1ier7 | mih4sên1iên7 | 乜生樣 |
| what situation | mi’4seu7     | mih4se7      | 乜事   |
| which one      | ti7tsek4kai5 | di7zêg4gai5  | 哋一個 |
| where          | ti7ko3       | di7go3       | 哋塊   |
| when           | tiang1si5    | diang1si5    | 珍時   |
| how            | tso2ni5      | zo2ni5       | 做呢   |
| how many       | kui2         | gui2         | 幾     |
| how many       | zie’4tsoi7   | riêh4zoi7    | 若濟   |

### “Who” and “whose” – *ti7tiang1*•*di7diang1*•哋㐱 or *tiang1*•*diang1*•㐱

NB: *tiang1* is usually printed with U+2B897 but this character is missing from many fonts, and is replaced here with 㐱.

“Whose” is formed by adding the genitive particle *kai5* 個

> Tsi1pung6 tshe’4 si7 **ti7tiang1-kai7**?
>
> Zi1bung6 cêh4 si7 **di7diang1-gai7**?
>
> 只本 冊 是 **哋㐱個**？
>
> This-CL book is **who-GEN**?
>
> Whose book is this?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Tsi1pung6 tshe’4 si7 i1-kai7
>
> Zi1bung6 cêh4 si7 i1-gai7
>
> 只本 冊 是 伊個
>
> This-CL book is he-GEN
>
> This book is his.

In Hokkien “who” is *siánn-lâng* 啥人, often contracted to *siánng*.

### “What” – *mi’4*•*mih4*•乜 and derivatives, *ti7kai5*•*di7gai5*•哋個

 * mi’4 – mih4 – 乜 – “what” generally
 * si7mi’4 – si7mih4 – 是乜 – “what” generally
 * ti7kai5 – di7gai5 – 哋個 – “what” generally
 * mi’4kai5 – mih4gai5 – 乜個 – “what thing”

The following statements are more or less equivalent:

> Leu2 lo6seung2 **ti7kai5**?
>
> Le2 lo6seng2 **di7gai5**?
>
> 汝 囉耍 **哋個**？
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Leu2 lo6seung2 **si7mi’4 (kai5)**?
>
> Le2 lo6seng2 **si7mih4 (gai5)**?
>
> 汝 囉耍 **是乜（個）**？
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Leu2 lo6seung2 **mi’4kai5**?
>
> Le2 lo6seng2 **mih4gai5**?
>
> 汝 囉耍 **乜個**？
>
> \*\*\*
>
> You PRG+play **what**?
>
> What (thing) are you playing with?

*mi’4kai5* can also mean “anything”:

> I1 mi’4kai5 long6 ai2 tsiak4.
>
> I1 mih4gai5 long6 ai2 ziag4.
>
> 伊 乜個 攏 愛 嚼。
>
> He anything all want eat.
>
> He’ll eat anything.

Other derivatives of *mi’4* 乜:

 * mi’4sier1ier7 – mih4siên1iên7 – 乜生樣 – “what manner”
 * mi’4seu7 – mih4se7 – 乜事 – “what occurrence/situation”

> Ning2 muar2zik8 tso2 **mi’4seu7**?
>
> Ning2 muan2rig8 zo2 **mih4se7**?
>
> 恁 ～日 做 **乜事**？
>
> You-pl. tomorrow do **what-thing**?
>
> What are you all up to tomorrow?

*mi’4* can also be used as an adverb to mean “a little bit” (see [“Comparisons”](pages/comparisons.md)).

### “Which” – *ti7tsek4kai5*•*di7zêg4gai5*•哋一個; compounds of *ti7*•*di7*•哋

Ti7tsek4kai5 哋一個 is clearly derived from ti7kai5 哋個.

> Tsi1tsho’4-mue’4 **ti7tsek4kai5** siang7-ngia2 ne5?
>
> Zi1coh4-muêh4 **di7zêg4gai5** siang7ngia2 nê5?
>
> 只撮物 **哋一個** 上雅 ne5？
>
> These-things **which-one** most-pretty SFP?
>
> Which of these is the prettiest?

*ti7* 哋 can be compounded with category nouns to ask the question “which of this category?” For example:

> I1 si7 **ti7**kok4 nang1?
>
> I1 si7 **di7**gog4 nang1?
>
> 伊 是 **哋**國 儂？
>
> He is **which**-country person?
>
> Which country is he from?

### “Where” – *ti7ko3*•*di7go3*•哋塊

> Lau1kung1tshu3 to7 **ti7ko3**?
>
> Lao1gung1cu3 do7 **di7go3**?
>
> 老君厝 在 **哋塊**？
>
> Doctor-house \[Hospital\] located **where**?
>
> Where is the hospital?

The possible responses “here” and “there” both contain ko3 塊

 * tsi1ko3 – zi1go3 – 只塊 –“here”
 * heu1ko3 – he1ko3 – 許塊 – “there”

The Hokkien equivalent to *ti7ko3* is *tó-loh* 佗落.

### “When” – *tiang1si5*•*diang1si5*•珍時

> Leu2 **tiang1si7** aih2kheu2 Hiang1kang2?
>
> Le2 **diang1si7** ain2ke2 Hiang1gang2?
>
> 汝 **珍時** 愛去 香港？
>
> You **when** want-go Hong Kong?
>
> When do you want to go to Hong Kong?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Ua2 e7kai7gue’8 tsiar2 kheu3
>
> Ua2 ê7gai7ghuêh8 zian2 ke3
>
> 我 下個 月 正 去
>
> I next-month then go
>
> I’m only going next month

To ask for the clock time, use *kui6tiam2* 幾點, see below.

### “How”, “Why” – *tso2ni5*•*zo2ni5*•做呢

*tso2ni5* 做呢 can be used to mean both “how” (what method/manner) and “why” (what reason).

> Ou7ni5 si7 **tso2ni7** tseu2-kai7 ne5?
>
> Ou7ni5 si7 **zo2ni7** ze2-gai7 nê5?
>
> 芋泥 是 **做呢** 煮個 ne？
>
> Yam-paste is **how** cook-X ne?
>
> How do you cook yam paste?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Leu2 **tso2ni7** tsier2ser1-uar3 tsiar2 teung2lai3?
>
> Le2 **zo2ni7** ziên2sên1-uan3 zian2 deng2lai3?
>
> 汝 **做呢** 照生 晏 正 轉來？
>
> You **why** so late then come-back?
>
> Why are you home so late?[^1]

#### *tso2ni7mue’4*•*zo2ni7muêh4*•做呢物•“What is to be done?”

> Na7-si7 leu2 ai2 tshuk8kok4, leu2-kai7 kau2 **tso2ni7mue’4**?
>
> Na7-si7 le2 ai2 cug8kok4, le2-gai7 gau2 **zo2ni7muêh4**?
>
> 哪是 汝 愛 出國，汝個 狗 **做呢物**？
>
> If you want travel, you-GEN dog **how-do**?
>
> What will be done about your dog, if you want to go traveling abroad?

### “How many” and “how much” – *kui2*•*gui2*•幾 and *zie’4tsoi7*•*riêh4zoi7*•若濟

Countable nouns use the interrogative *kui2* 幾 + \[classifier\].

> Leu2 u7 **kui6-kai5** hiar1ti6-tse6mui7?
>
> Le2 u7 **gui6-gai5** hian1di6-ze6mui7?
>
> 汝 有 **幾個** 兄弟姐妹？
>
> You have \[**how-many\]-CL** brothers-sisters?
>
> How many siblings do you have?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Tse6tsung5 **kui6tiam2**?
>
> Zê6zung5 **gui6diam2**?
>
> 這陣 **幾點**？
>
> Now **\[how-many\]-hours**?
>
> What is the time?

Uncountable quantities use the interrogative *zie’8* 若 + \[adjective\], generically *zie’4tsoi7* 若濟 “how much”.

> Leu2kai7 kiar2 u7 thang2 **zie’4tsoi7** tsih5?
>
> Le2gai7 gian2 u7 tang2 **riêh4zoi7** zin5?
>
> 汝個 兒 有 賺 **若濟** 錢？
>
> You-CL child have earn **how-much** money?
>
> How much does *your* child earn?[^2]
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Thoi2 ui1seng1 ai2 tang2 **zie’4** ku2?
>
> Toi2 ui1sêng1 ai2 dang2 **riêh4** gu2?
>
> 睇 醫生 愛 等 **若** 久？
>
> See doctor want wait **how-much**-long?
>
> How long is the wait to see a doctor?

*zie’4tsoi7* 若濟 can also be used for countable nouns instead of *kui2* 幾.

The Hokkien *lōa* 偌 or *lōa-chōe* 偌濟 may sometimes be substituted by people who speak both languages.

### “How” – *tsai7tek4*•*zai7dêg4*•怎得 and *tsai7ser1*•*zai7sên1*•怎生

<!--
See *Knowing one but not the other* 只知其一，不知其二, 陳四文 for examples
-->

### Particle *ne7*•*nê7*•呢/呤

Questions with interrogative pronouns can optionally end with the particle *ne7* 呢/呤, which functions very much like the Mandarin *nē* 呢. Because of how quickly it is pronounced and the use of tonal inflections for emphasis, the tone of this particle will vary with speaker and context. See “Interrogative particles” below.

Yes-no questions – A-NOT-A pattern
----------------------------------

Mandarin primarily uses the A-NOT-A construction for yes-no questions:

> Zhè zhī shǒujī **shìbùshì** nǐde?
>
> 這支 手機 **是不是** 你的？
>
> This-CL handphone **is-NOT-is** you-GEN?
>
> Is this your handphone?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Nǐ **yàobùyào** gēn wǒmén chūqù?
>
> 你 **要不要** 跟 我們 出去？
>
> You **want-NOT-want** with us go-out?
>
> Do you want to go out with us?

Cantonese uses a similar pattern, e.g. *haih-m-haih* 係唔係 is-NOT-is.

In Teochew, the A-NOT-A pattern is not as prevalent as in Mandarin. The first example above can be translated quite directly:

> Tsi2-ki1 tshiu6ki1 **si7m7si7** leu2-kai5?
>
> Zi2-gi1 ciu6gi1 **si7m7si7** le2-gai5?
>
> 只支 手機 **是唔是** 汝個？
>
> This-CL handphone **is-NOT-is** you-GEN?

*si7m7si6 *是唔是 can be replaced by *ka’4si6* 豈是.

The short answer to a yes-no question is either the verb or its negation. In the example above, this would be *si6* 是 if yes, and *m7si6* 唔是 if not.

The A-NOT-A pattern is more common in short questions, e.g.

> **Tie’4m7tie’8**?
>
> **Diêh4m7diêh8**?
>
> 着唔着
>
> **correct-NOT-correct**?
>
> Is this correct?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> “Yes”: Tie’8 – 着
>
> “No”: M7tie’8 – 唔着
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Leu2 **sek8m7sek4** zi7?
>
> Le2 **sêg8m7sêg4** ri7?
>
> 汝 **識唔識** 字？
>
> you **read-NOT-read** words?
>
> Are you literate?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> “Yes”: Sek4 – 識
>
> “No”: M7sek4 – 唔識

Words which take specific negative forms use those forms instead of the pattern A + *m7* 唔 + A (see [“Negatives”](pages/negatives.md)):

> Leu2 **ai7mai7**?
>
> Le2 **ai7mai7**?
>
> 汝 **愛勿**？
>
> you **want-NEG**?
>
> Do you want it or not?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> “Yes”: Ai7 – 愛
>
> “No”: Mai7 – 勿

The pair *ho2mo2* 好孬 “should-shouldn’t” can be used at the end of a sentence to seek confirmation or approval of a suggestion.

> Nang2 muar2zik8 kheu2 tier2heu5, **ho2mo2**?
>
> Nang2 muan2zig8 ke2 diên2he5, **ho2mo2**?
>
> 俺 ～日 去 釣魚，**好孬**？
>
> We-incl. tomorrow go fishing, **should-shouldn’t**?
>
> How about we go fishing tomorrow?

Yes-no questions – Clause-negative pattern
------------------------------------------

Another way to form a yes-no question is to add a negative (see [“Negatives”](pages/negatives.md)) to the end of the clause.

Compare “or not” in Singaporean English: “He got wear trousers or not?”.

> I1 u7 tsheng7khou7 **a1bo5**?
>
> I1 u7 cêng7kou7 **a1bho5**?
>
> 伊 有 穿褲 **呀無**？
>
> He have wear-pants **or-NEG**?
>
> Was he wearing pants?

This pattern would not be idiomatic in Mandarin: \**Tā yǒu chuānkù huòméi?* \*他 有 穿褲 或沒？One would instead use the A-NOT-A pattern: *Tā yǒuméiyǒu chuānkù*? 他 有沒有 穿褲？

A more commonplace example:

> Leu2 u7-ziak4 **a1bo5**?
>
> Le2 u7-riag4 **a1bho5**?
>
> 汝 有食 **呀無**？
>
> You have-eat **or-NEG**?
>
> Did you eat?

The negative can either be preceded by *a1* 呀 or not. If *a1* 呀 is omitted, then the negative takes a low tone: *Leu2 ziak4pa2-lou7 **bo7***?

### General purpose – *a1bo5*•*a1bho5*•呀無

> Tsi2-ki1 tshiu6ki1 si7 leu2-kai5 **a1bo5**?
>
> Zi2-gi1 ciu6gi1 si7 le2-gai5 **a1bo5**?
>
> 只支 手機 是 汝個 **呀無**？
>
> This-CL handphone is you-GEN **or-NEG**?

An alternative to *a1bo5* is *a1mi6* 呀~.

### “Yet” – *a1bue7*•*a1bhuê7*•呀未

To ask if an action has been started or completed yet.

> Leu2 ziak4pa2-lou7 **bue7**?
>
> Le2 riag4ba2-lou7 **bhuê7**?
>
> 汝 食飽𡀔 **未**？
>
> You eat-PERF **NEG**?
>
> Have you eaten yet?

### Likelihood – *a1boi6*•*a1bhoi6*•呀\[不會\]

Usually paired with the verb *oi6* 會 “can/will”.

> Leu2 oi7hiao6 tseu6 ou7ni1 **a1boi6**?
>
> Le2 oi7hiao6 tse6 ou7ni1 **a1boi6**?
>
> 汝 會曉 煮 芋泥 **呀\[不+會\]**？
>
> You able-know cook yam-paste **or-NEG**?
>
> Do you know how to cook yam paste or not?

### Preference – *a1mai3*•*a1mai3*•呀勿

Usually paired with the verb *ai3* 愛 “want”.

> Leu2 ai2ziak4 ou7ni1 **a1mai3**?
>
> Le2 ai2riag4 ou7ni1 **a1mai3**?
>
> 汝 愛食 芋泥 **呀勿**？
>
> You want-eat yam-paste **or-NEG**?
>
> Do you want to eat yam paste?

Yes/no questions – Interrogative particles
------------------------------------------

The more common way to phrase yes-no questions in Teochew is by adding an interrogative particle or negative at the end of the sentence or clause. Mandarin also has particles of this sort, e.g. *mā* 嗎. The different particles convey different shades of meaning.

See [“Particles”](pages/particles.md) for the use of particles in general.

### Particle *me7*•*mê7*•\[口+乜\] – Yes/no

The first Mandarin example from the previous section can be rephrased:

> Tsi2-ki1 tshiu6ki1 si7 leu2-kai5 **me7**?
>
> Zi2-gi1 ciu6gi1 si7le2-gai5 **me7**?
>
> 只支 手機 是 汝個 **me7**？
>
> This-CL handphone is you-GEN **SFP**?
>
> Is this your handphone?

If the interrogative particle is removed, what remains is a sentence that could serve as an affirmative answer to the question.

### Particle *me5*•*mê5*•\[口+乜\] – Expressing skepticism

Changing the tone from *me7* to *me5* expresses skepticism:

> Tsi2-ki1 tshiu6ki1 si7 leu2-kai5 **me5**?
>
> Zi2-gi1 ciu6gi1 si7le2-gai5 **me5**?
>
> 只支 手機 是 汝個 **me5**？
>
> This-CL handphone is you-GEN **SFP**?
>
> Are you sure that this is your handphone?

### Particle *har2*•*han2*•𠳝 – Seeking confirmation

When the question refers to an earlier statement, or a fact that is understood from context, and which can be confirmed by a simple yes-no answer:

> Tsi2-ki1 tshiu6ki1 si7 leu2-kai5 **har2**?
>
> Zi2-gi1 ciu6gi1 si7le2-gai5 **har2**?
>
> 只支 手機 是 汝個 **𠳝**？
>
> This-CL handphone is you-GEN **SFP**?
>
> This is your handphone, right?

Interrogative particles – *ne5* 呢 questions
------------------------------------------

The particle *ne5* does not necessarily accompany a yes-no type question.

### Particle *ne5*•*nê5*•呢 – Reciprocal questions

If a question has already been asked and answered, but now the speaker would like to apply the same question to a new subject, like the Mandarin *nē*. *ne5* is also written with the character 呤.

> Tsi2-ki1 tshiu6ki1 si7 leu2-kai5. Heu2kai7 **ne5**?
>
> Zi2-gi1 ciu6gi1 si7 le2-gai5. He2gai7 **nê5**?
>
> 只支 手機 是 汝個。 許個 **呢**？
>
> This-CL handphone is you-GEN. That **SFP**?
>
> This is your handphone. What about that one?

### Particle *ne5*•*nê5*•呢 – “Softening” questions

The particle *ne5* can also be added to most questions, which do not already use one of the particles above, to “soften” the question so that it does not sound so abrupt.

> Leu2 tso2ni7 mung7 tsie2ser1 tsoi7 **ne5**?
>
> Le2 zo2ni7 mung7 ziê2sên1 zoi7 **nê5**?
>
> 汝 做呢 問 照生 濟 **呢**？
>
> You why ask this-manner much **SFP**?
>
> Why do you ask so many questions?

Expressing skepticism
---------------------

In addition to the particle *me5* \[口+乜\] (see above), there are some set phrases used to express skepticism.

> U7 iar2 bo6?
>
> U7 ian2 bho6?
>
> 有 影 無？
>
> Have earnest NEG?
>
> Are you serious?
>
> \*\*\*
>
> Tsing1sek8-kai7 me5?
>
> Zing1sêg8-gai7 me5?
>
> 真實個 me5?
>
> Real-CL SFP?
>
> Is this for real?

Polite questions
----------------

Several set phrases are used to ask questions politely. These are used more or less the same way as their Mandarin equivalents.

*tshia6mung7* 請問 literally means “invite ask”, i.e. “may I ask”, and is used like the Mandarin cognate *qǐngwèn*.

> **Tshia6mung7** sing1ser1 kui2ser3?
>
> **Cia6mung7** sing1sên1 gui2sên3?
>
> **請問** 先生 貴姓？
>
> **May-ask** mister esteemed-surname?
>
> May I ask what is your name?

In the example above, the prefix *kui3* 貴 “precious” or “esteemed” is used in a formal or polite context as a synonym for the second person possessive pronoun.

*mua7hueng5-leu7* is used to ask someone to do something, literally meaning “bother you”, like the English phrase “could I trouble you to …”.

> **Mua7hueng5-leu7** seng1 theung2oi5 tsiar2 zip8lai7.
>
> **Mua7huêng5-le7** sêng1 teng2oi5 zian2 rib8lai7.
>
> **麻煩 汝** 先 褪鞋 正 入來。
>
> **Bother you** first take-off-shoes then enter.
>
> Could you please take off your shoes before entering?
