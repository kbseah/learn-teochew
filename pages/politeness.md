Questions and requests
----------------------

Several set phrases are used to ask questions politely. These are used more or
less the same way as their Mandarin equivalents.

*cia2(6)mung7* 請問 literally means “invite ask”, i.e. “may I ask”, and is used
like the Mandarin cognate *qǐngwèn*.

> **tsʰia³⁵ muŋ¹¹** siŋ³³ sẽ³³ kui⁵³ sẽ²¹³
>
> **Cia2(6)mung7** sing1sên1 gui3(2)sên3?
>
> *請問* 先生 貴姓？
>
> **May-ask** mister esteemed-surname?
>
> May I ask what is your name?

In the example above, the prefix *gui3* 貴 “precious” or “esteemed” is used in
a formal or polite context as a synonym for the second person possessive
pronoun.

*mua7huêng5-le7* 麻煩汝 is used to ask someone to do something, literally
meaning “bother you”, like the English phrase “could I trouble you to …”.

> **mua¹¹hueŋ⁵⁵ lɯ¹¹** seŋ³³ tʰɯŋ⁵³ oi⁵⁵ tsĩã⁵³ zip⁵lai¹¹
>
> **Mua7huêng5-le7** sêng1 teng3(2)oi5 zian2 rib4(8)lai7.
>
> *麻煩 汝* 先 褪鞋 正 入來。
>
> **Bother you** first take-off-shoes then enter.
>
> Could you please take off your shoes before entering?

*lui6-le7* 累汝 is similar to *mua7huêng5-le7* and is also used to make polite
requests.

> **lui¹¹ lɯ¹¹** kʰioʔ² hɯ²⁵ saŋ³³ tua¹¹ tiʔ² kĩã²¹³ kai¹¹ kʰɯk² ua¹¹
>
> **lui6-le7** kioh8(4) he2(6)-sang1 dua7-dih8(4)gian3-gai5(7) keg4 ua2(7)
> 
> *累汝* 挈 許雙 大滴囝 個 乞 我
>
> **Trouble you** take that-pair(CL) big-a-bit-GAI PASS me
>
> Could I trouble you to give me that slightly bigger pair (of shoes)?
>
> (《潮州話口語入門》20)

To ask for someone’s name, address them by a suitable title, such as
*sing1sên1* 先生 (“sir”) (see [“Terms of address”]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
pages/address.md %})), followed by *gui3(2)sên3* 貴姓 (“honored surname”), as in
the example above under *cian2(6)mung7*.

Other questions about a person can also be prefixed with *gui3* (examples from
Fielde, pg. 280):

> tsuŋ³³ ke²¹³ **kui⁵² sẽ²¹³**
> 
> zung1gê3 **gui3(2)sên3**?
>
> 尊駕 *貴姓*？
>
> respected-sir **honorable-name**?
>
> How should I address you, sir?

> **kui⁵² hu⁵²** ti¹¹ ko²¹³
>
> **gui3(2)hu2** di7go3?
>
> *貴府* 底塊？
>
> **honorable-residence** where?
>
> Where is your residence?

> to¹¹ niŋ⁵² **kui⁵² kok²** lai¹¹ kau⁵² uŋ⁵² tsi²⁵ko²¹³ dzieʔ² hɯŋ²⁵
>
> do6(7) ning2 **gui3(2)gog4** lai5(7)-gao3(2) ung2 zi2(6)go3 riêh4 heng6?
>
> 在 恁 *貴國* 來到 阮 只塊 若 遠？
>
> from you-pl. **honorable-country** come-to we-excl. here how far?
>
> How far is it from your home country to ours?


Apologies
---------

*mo2(6)i3(2)se3* 孬意思, literally meaning “embarrassment”, is similar to
Mandarin 不好意思 *bùhǎoyìsì*, to ask to be excused for a small fault or error.

> **mo²⁵ i⁵² sɯ²¹³** / ua⁵² bo¹¹ pik² ho²⁵ tsieʔ⁵ lɯ²¹³
>
> **mo2(6)i3(2)se3**, ua2 bho5(7) big4 ho2(6) ziêh4(8) le3
>
> *孬意思*，我 無 筆 好 借 汝
>
> **embarrassment**, I NEG pen able lend you
>
> I’m sorry, I don’t have a pen to lend you

*dui3(2)m6(7)zu6* 對唔住 is similar to Mandarin 對不起 *dùibùqǐ*, and is used for
more substantial apologies.

> **tui⁵² m¹¹ tsu²⁵** / si¹¹ ua⁵² tʰau³³ kʰiek² lɯ⁵² kai¹¹ pik²
>
> **dui3(2)m6(7)zu6**, si6(7) ua2 tao1kiêg4 le2-gai7 big4
>
> *對唔住*，是 我 偷挈 汝個 筆
>
> **apology**, is I stole you-CL pen
>
> I’m sorry, I was the one who stole your pen.

In addition, diaspora Teochews may also use *pai2(6)sê3* 歹勢 to mean “excuse
me”, which is a borrowing from Hokkien.


Giving and receiving thanks
---------------------------

*sia7sia7* 謝謝 “thanks”, *zoi7sia7* 濟謝 (also written 㩼謝) “many thanks”,
and *gam2(6)sia7* 感謝 “heartfelt thanks” can all be used to thank somebody for
something.

An appropriate response is *miang2(6)kêh4(8)ki3* 免客氣 or *mai3(2)kêh4(8)ki3*
勿客氣, meaning “there’s no need to be polite”.
