Learn Teochew with Ah Boon
==========================
{: .fs-9}

Welcome to Learn Teochew with Ah Boon! I'm Ah Boon 阿文, and this is an online
study guide to the Teochew (潮州, Teo-Swa, Chaozhou, Chiuchow) language.

👉 This guide is for heritage speakers – people like me, who have learned some
of the language from their family but who have never studied it formally, and
who want to improve their understanding of the language.

👉 If you have no prior knowledge of Teochew, one of the resources listed in the
[Preface]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/preface.md %}) may be more helpful.

👉 First review the page on [pronunciation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/pronunciation.md %}) to learn the
phonetic spelling used on this website.

Technical note
--------------

This website makes use of extended CJK characters and other special characters
that may not be supported by the default fonts on many computers. Unsupported
characters should appear as a question mark � or empty boxes on most systems.

If you cannot see the following Chinese characters –

> 𠁞
> 𫢗

then you should download a font that supports extended CJK characters, such as
[Noto Sans CJK TC](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) (follow the installation
instructions for your operating system).

These rare characters are only used in a few places in this guide, and the
Chinese characters in this guide are only a supplement to the phonetic spelling,
so you will still be able to see most of the content on the site without
installing additional CJK fonts.

If you cannot see the following IPA and accented characters –

> əɯʰ˧˥˦ŋ
> āáǎàâ

then you should download a font that supports IPA characters.
