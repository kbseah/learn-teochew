Learn Teochew with Ah Boon
==========================
{: .fs-9}

Welcome to Learn Teochew with Ah Boon! I'm Ah Boon 阿文, and this is an online
study guide to the Teochew (潮州, Teo-Swa, Chaozhou, Chiuchow) language.

### Who is this for?

This guide is primarily targeted at heritage speakers like myself, people who
have learned some of the language from their family but who have never learned
it formally, and who would like to improve their understanding of the language.
If you have no prior knowledge of Teochew, one of the resources listed in the
[Preface](pages/preface.md) may be more helpful.

### How can I stay updated?

These pages will continue to be expanded and updated, so do check back often!

Learn Teochew is a passion project of mine, and I am committed to keeping it
free for learners. If you would like to support the project, please visit my

page on [pronunciation](pages/pronunciation.md).

## Technical note

This website makes use of extended CJK characters and other special characters
that may not be supported by the default fonts on many computers. Nonetheless,
it is still possible to view most of the content without them.

If you cannot see the following Chinese characters –

> 𠁞
> 𫢗

then you should download a font that supports extended CJK characters, such as
[Noto Sans CJK TC](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) (follow the installation
instructions for your operating system).

If you cannot see the following IPA and accented characters –

> əɯʰ˧˥˦ŋ
> āáǎàâ

then you should download a font that supports IPA characters.
