## Empathy for a Toothache

Teochew idiom:

> ki2tian3 zian3 zai1 ki2tian3 nang5
>
> 齒疼 正 知 齒疼 儂
>
> “Only when your own teeth hurt will you understand someone with a toothache“


Unless you yourself have suffered a certain pain, you will not fully understand someone else who is living with that pain. This idiom is a call to be empathetic, and a reminder that we should try to see things from the other party's point of view.
