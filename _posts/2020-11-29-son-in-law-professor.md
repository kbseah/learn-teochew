## Professor Son-in-law

Short video profile (in Cantonese, with Chinese subtitles) of Prof Stephen Matthews, a linguist from Hong Kong University who studies Cantonese language. His wife, Prof Virginia Yip, who is also a linguist and an expert on bilingualism, is from Hong Kong, but her family is Teochew, so when he first came to HK he not only had to learn Cantonese but also Teochew! They have also done research on Teochew language, although their work on Cantonese is better known (e.g. Cantonese - A Comprehensive Grammar, Routledge, 2nd ed. 2011)

The video is titled 潮州女婿 ("Teochew son-in-law"). However the Teochew word for son-in-law is gian2sai3 • 囝婿.
