## Peace is a Great Blessing

Teochew idiom:

> pêng5ang1 deng1 dua7tang3
>
> 平安 當 大賺
>
> "peace is a great blessing"

This means that good health, a harmonious home, and stable finances are as good as striking it rich. This reflects the Teochew attitude of being content with one's blessings.
tang3 赚 is also written 趁. Writing it as 赚 is an example of 训用, using a Mandarin or Classical Chinese character to represent a dialect word, even though strictly speaking they may not have the same etymology. The literary pronunciation of 赚 is zuang3.
