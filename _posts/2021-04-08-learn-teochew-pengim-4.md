title: Teochew Pêng'im (4) - Finals

Teochew has eight different tones and a complex set of tone changes between
them. This can be daunting for new learners.

In this new video, we introduce the different tones and tone change rules, to
help you learn the basics!

This is the last of the four videos on Teochew Pêng'im. We hope that they will
help people learn how to write Teochew phonetically, and also to be able to
read the Teochew Pêng'im that we use on this website.
