title: Teochew Pêng'im (1) - Vowels

In our previous posts here, and on the [Learn Teochew
website](https://kbseah.github.io/learn-teochew), we use Teochew Pêng'im to
spell Teochew. This is a phonetic spelling system that accurately represents
the sounds of the Teochew language.

The system is not too difficult to learn, and is similar in many ways to Hanyu
Pinyin, which most people who learned Mandarin in school will also have
learned. However, it is probably easier to learn Pêng'im if you can listen to
the sounds at the same time, instead of just from a textual description.

Therefore, we are preparing a series of videos on Teochew Pêng'im. The first
one explains the vowel sounds in Teochew and how to write them in Pêng'im. Each
video has narrations and transcription in Teochew, as well as subtitles in
English and Mandarin.

The next videos will be released over the coming weeks. There may be some
delays because video editing and subtitling takes time and is still new to us.

We hope that you will enjoy this new content, and welcome any suggestions for
improvement.
