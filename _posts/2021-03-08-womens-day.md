We wish everybody a meaningful International Women’s Day!

In Teochew:

 * hu6neng2 zoih4 • 婦女節 • Women’s Day
 * hu6neng2 • 婦女 • woman, female (formal)
 * ze1nio5 • 諸娘 • woman, female (vernacular, especially on mainland China)
 * za1bhou2 • 查某 • woman, female (vernacular, especially diaspora Teochew)
 * zao2gian2 • 走囝 • girl (child) (zao2 is a contraction of za1bhou2)

(On the etymology of za1bhou2 and ze1nio5 see [Tu Chia-lun
(2018)](http://www.twlls.org.tw/jtll/documents/13.2-1.pdf))

Cognates of ze1nio5 and za1bhou2 are used in the various Min languages.
Unfortunately, za1bhou2 has taken on a negative connotation in Teochew spoken
on mainland China, although not in most diaspora Teochew communities.

We also want to highlight some important works on Teochew language that have
been written by women:

   description of the Jieyang variety. J. Chinese Linguistics Monograph Series
   No. 22. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong Press.

   phonological change in the Teochew topolect) 北京：商務印書館
