We wish everybody a meaningful International Women’s Day!

In Teochew:

 * hu6neng2 zoih4 • 婦女節 • Women’s Day
 * hu6neng2 • 婦女 • woman, female (formal)
 * ze1nio5 • 諸娘 • woman, female (vernacular, especially on mainland China)
 * za1bhou2 • 查某 • woman, female (vernacular, especially diaspora Teochew)
 * zao2gian2 • 走囝 • girl (child) (zao2 is a contraction of za1bhou2)

Cognates of ze1nio5 and za1bhou2 are used in the various Min languages.
Unfortunately, za1bhou2 has taken on a negative connotation in Teochew spoken
on mainland China, although not in most diaspora Teochew communities.

On the etymology of za1bhou2 and ze1nio5 see [Tu Chia-lun (2018)](http://www.twlls.org.tw/jtll/documents/13.2-1.pdf)
