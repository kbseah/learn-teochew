Many ethnic Chinese in France are Teochews; they are supposed to be numerous in
the 13th arrondissement of Paris.

This is a fascinating talk by a French Teochew named Oung-Heng Heng, delivered
to a meeting of language enthusiasts in 2019. His family background shows how
migration has been so important to Teochew history: they migrated from Teochew
to Cambodia, then fled to Thailand during the war in Cambodia, and finally were
granted asylum in France.

Heng himself grew up in France but speaks Teochew at home, I think that he has
an interesting French-GÃªg'ion accent.

The talk also gives a very good overview of the Teochew language, delivered
partly in Teochew and in English. Highly recommended!
