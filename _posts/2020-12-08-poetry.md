She wrote the work in the 1950s, but was afraid to publish it because she had only three years of formal schooling, which was interrupted by the Japanese occupation of Singapore during World War II. It was only about sixty years later that she showed it to others, and was encouraged to have it published.

The National Archives of Singapore has an oral history recording of her that can be [streamed online](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/oral_history_interviews/record-details/65561c47-c831-11e6-b045-0050568939ad?fbclid=IwAR2ZV0c_UUsF6XegZmyL29rzm7ARqXIenl1qFbNCWQMqTxD0ZM2IpbmZNg0) (interview in Mandarin, brief summary in English).

Her poetry and autobiography are available at the [National Library of Singapore](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/ENQ/WPAC/BIBENQ?SETLVL=1&BRN=14372456)
