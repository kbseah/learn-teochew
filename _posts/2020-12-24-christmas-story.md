## The Christmas Story in Teochew

Christmas is soon upon us, and our Christian friends might appreciate hearing the Christmas story in Teochew. This version (Luke 2:4-14) comes from an 1892 translation of the Four Gospels and Book of Acts in romanized Teochew, published by Presbyterian missionaries from Britain.

In the following extract, the original romanization is given first, followed by the modern Teochew Peng’im, a rendering of the Teochew in Chinese characters, and an English translation (King James Version), as well as vocabulary notes. Two characters used in the original romanization are substituted here: “u” with two dots below is replaced with “w”, and superscript “n” is replaced with “N”.

You can read the original [here](http://bible.fhl.net/gbdoc/ob/nob.html?book=145). In addition to Teochew, Bible translations in other Chinese languages, mostly produced by missionaries in the 19th and early 20th centuries, can be found on this website. It is certainly a very useful resource both for Chinese linguistics and for the history of Christianity in China and Chinese-speaking communities.

The two main groups of Protestant missionaries in the Teochew / Swatow region were American Baptists and the Presbyterians. The Baptists produced a Bible translation using Chinese characters, whereas the Presbyterians published their own with romanized Teochew.

According to an article by Don Snow and Chen Nuanling (“Missionaries and written Chaoshanese”, 2015), this reflected different attitudes on how best to deal with the vernacular Teochew language, which does not have a standard written form in Chinese characters, which they represent as more “culturally conservative” (using characters) vs. “much more radical” (using only romanization). Nonetheless, the romanized text is still “bookish” in its vocabulary and style.

The romanization also preserves some older features of pronunciation that changed between the 19th and 20th centuries. Most noticeably, in the 19th century there were still syllables ending in [-in] in Teochew, which are mostly pronounced as [-ing] today (e.g. “in” 𪜶 “they/them” vs. “ing1”), and some syllables ending in [-t], which now are pronounced [-g] (e.g. “jit” 日 “day” vs. “rig8”)
