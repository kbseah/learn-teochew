Pupils in Singapore (where I grew up) get an upside-down understanding of the
term "mother tongue", because in school it is the language they are told to
learn (in addition to English) based on what 'race' is registered on their
birth certificate. In most of the world, "mother tongue" is simply the language
that one knows the best, which for most people is also the language they speak
at home.

Mother Language Day is intended to remind us that many people around the world
can't get an education in their mother tongue or a language they speak at home.
Many languages are also disappearing or endangered because they are not being
passed on to the next generation.

Regardless of what you feel your own mother language is, we hope that you will
treasure it and have plenty of opportunities to speak it!
