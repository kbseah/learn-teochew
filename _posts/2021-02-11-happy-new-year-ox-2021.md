Learn Teochew wishes everybody a happy Year of the Ox! (Because we are promoting Teochew and not Mandarin, we won't make a joke about “happy 牛 year”.)

When I was a kid I learned the common New Year greetings in Mandarin: xīnniánkuàilè 新年快樂, gōngxǐfācái 恭喜發財, wànshìrúyì 萬事如意, and so on. But when visiting older relatives, my parents told me to say something in Teochew which I didn't really understand at the time: sing1zian1 ru5(7)i3. Only as an adult did I understand that this means 新正如意.

> sing1zian1 ru5(7)i3 新正如意 - may your wishes be fulfilled in the new year

Vocabulary for the Lunar New Year:

> sing1zian1 新正 - “new first month”, the first month of the lunar calendar is called zian1guêh8 正月
>
> zian1guêh8 ciu1ig4 正月初一 – First day of the First month in the calendar (i.e. “new year’s day”)
>
> cung1zoih4 春節 - “Spring Festival”; another name for the New Year festival

Some more New Year greetings in Teochew:

> sing1ni5 kuai3(2)lag8 新年快樂
>
> giong1hi2 huêg4(8)cai5 恭喜發財
>
> sing1ni5 huêg4(8)cai5 新年發財

We hope that learning some of these greetings will help you give your older relatives a pleasant surprise, whether you are able to see them in person or are sending them virtual greetings.
