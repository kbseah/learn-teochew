Growing up in Singapore, I learned a little bit of Teochew from my grandmother and some older relatives, but learned English and Mandarin at school, and spoke mostly English with friends and family. I told myself that "some day" I would learn Teochew properly.

However it was not easy to find learning materials, especially in English. It was all the more difficult as I am now based abroad. When looking over my notes and the material I had accumulated, I thought that I should share what I had to help others who like me are heritage speakers of Teochew.

After more than a year of working on it in my spare time, the site is now online at the link below.

I hope that it will be a useful resource for anyone who wants to reconnect with their roots and communicate better with loved ones. Suggestions and feedback are welcome; the site will be updated from time to time.
