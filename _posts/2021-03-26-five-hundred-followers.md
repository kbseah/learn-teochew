For those who are new here, a short introduction to this page:

We post about Teochew language in English to help heritage speakers (people who
learned a bit of the language at home as children, but who do not speak it
fluently) to learn and improve their Teochew. Teochew content is written in
Teochew Pêng'im and characters, but because characters for Teochew are not
standardized the usage here may differ from other websites and sources.

At the moment this is a one-man-operation. I am myself a heritage speaker and
am still learning along the way, so please leave a message if you find
inaccuracies.

This Facebook page accompanies our main website, which has a grammar and usage
guide to Teochew:

We also have a Twitter presence at https://twitter.com/LearnTeochew

Posts are roughly once a week, or whenever I find something interesting!
However because of other commitments there may sometimes be extended breaks.

I'm looking forward to another year of learning Teochew with everybody!
